2023-12-16T04:41:33Z	"Thanks to all of you! I appreciate the Piazza and direct thanks from all of you. But from me and from the rest of the staff let us say thanks too.

For all of us -- myself, Emily, and the TAs -- being part of the first course in CS is a privilege. We get the pleasure of helping you get started on the path of research university computer science. Or learning not to &#34;just bang on the keyboard till it works&#34;! 

It&#39;s a real pleasure for all of us to see you learn that, to see you discover the fun and beauty in it, to learn that you can solve difficult design problems.  It&#39;s a pleasure to think that we have helped you get started on your way.

So thanks to you all for being a great class; for asking lots of questions in class, on Piazza and in office hours; and for your patience when things didn&#39;t work exactly as we wanted them to.

Whatever your traditions are, I hope that you will be able to get some good rest time over the break.

Let us know how things go for you down the road.

2023-12-14T21:49:04Z	"Grades &amp; End of Term Announcements Hi everyone, final Lab, Problem Set, Lecture, and Midterm grades are being released on Canvas right now! They&#39;re not all out at this moment, as it take a few minutes per assignment, but they will be shortly. I apologize for the delay - there were a number of factors that slowed down the process this term and I am working on improvements. Please read this entire message and the entire Assignments and Grading section of the syllabus carefully before asking any questions. Questions that are answered by this message or the syllabus will not receive a response.
 
FAQs
1. How are lab/problem set grades calculated
Please review the Assignments and Grading section of the syllabus, specifically the lab and problem set sub-sections.
 
2. Why is my autograder score X?
Please carefully review the feedback in your autograder report. You can find more details about autograder reports here.
 
3. My autograder score is X, why is my final lab/problem set grade lower?
Please review the Assignments and Grading section of the syllabus, specifically the lab and problem set sub-sections.
 
4. Do all lab/problem set grades count?
Your lowest lab grade and lowest problem set grade have been dropped in the &#34;Total Lab Grade&#34; and &#34;Total Problem Set Grade&#34; columns, in addition to any exemptions confirmed by the Course Coordinator.
 
5. Why did my autograder score change?
If we find an error in the autograder for an assignment then our fix of that error may cause your final autograder score to go up or down. Don&#39;t rely on the autograder score alone, you should be 100% confident in your work before submitting it.
 
6. Why is one of my grades EX in Canvas?
If you have an exemption for an assignment, your grade for that assignment on Canvas will be EX. This is our way of indicating that we need to omit that grade when we calculate final grades.
 
7.Are Canvas&#39; total grade calculations accurate?
No, please only refer to individual assignments (e.g., Lab 1: Intro) or your &#34;Total Lab Grade&#34; and &#34;Total Problem Set Grade&#34; as Canvas&#39; total columns (e.g., Labs) do not take exemptions in to account.
 
8. How do I request a regrade for a Lab or Problem Set?
Please follow the instructions in the Regrade Request Policy in the syllabus. Note that the deadline to request a regrade is 11:59 PM on Wednesday, December 20.
 
9. Will final exam grades and final course grades be released on Canvas?
No, final exam grades and final course grades will not be released on Canvas. You will not know your final grade in the course until the final exam period ends and final course grades have been released through the SSC. This can take up to 7 business days after the date of the final exam.
 
10. Can I see my final exam?
If you would like to schedule a meeting to view your final exam, you will have the opportunity to submit a Final Exam Viewing Form between December 23-January 19. Please note that exam viewings are purely for learning purposes and viewing your final exam is not an opportunity to request a regrade.
 
11. Will there be regrade requests for the final exam?
The course team is unable to accept regrade requests for the final exam. If you sign up for an exam and wish to dispute your grade after viewing your exam, you will need to apply for a Review of Assigned Standing.
 
Term-specific Notes
1. iClicker questions did not start counting towards your Lecture grade until Tuesday, October 10. We also increased the number of automatically dropped lectures from 2 to 4 lectures, due to various technical issues throughout the term.
2. As specified in @1044, your Midterm 2 Problem 5 grade replaced your Midterm 1 Problem 4 grade, if your Midterm 2 Problem 5 grade was higher.
 
Wishing you all the best for the remainder of exam season and your future studies. We hope you have a happy and healthy holiday break!"	1733

UBC defines exam clashes and exam hardships as outlined below:
An examination clash is when a student has multiple formal examinations scheduled on the same day and at the same time, or where the allotted times for scheduled formal examinations overlap.An examination hardship is defined as the occurrence of an examination candidate being faced with three (3) or more formal examinations scheduled within a 24-hour period (e.g., from 8:00 AM to 7:59 AM the following day). Please only fill out this survey if CPSC 110 is the second (middle) examination in your exam hardship."	876
2023-11-06T23:05:57Z	"Midterm 1 Problem 4 




























PLEASE READ EVERY WORD OF THE FOLLOWING. THERE IS AN IMPORTANT CHANGE TO MIDTERM 1 GRADING HERE.
On midterm 1 problem 4 we observed a few different kinds of problems: 
Some students made errors involving missing or incorrect @htdf tagsSome students designed primary functions that operated on Gift instead of PackageSome students did not resolve the problem with inconsistency in order of height, width, and lengthSome students commented out their solution because of the ambiguity.
 The first point to make is that correct tags are a requirement for all problems. In the future it is critical that you always get the @htdf tags correct – without them the grader cannot find the function to grade.

The second point is that it is critical to read problem directions very carefully and follow them.

The third point is that if you see a possible mistake in the problem do what you think is reasonable. DO NOT TRY TO ASK A QUESTION DURING THE EXAM. Just do what you think is reasonable.

The fourth point is that you should not comment out your solution. The autograder does not grade anything that is commented out.

But, taking all the above into account, we have come up with what we think is a simple and more than fair resolution for all these problems: 


After midterm 2, your midterm 1 problem 4 score will become the higher of the original score and your midterm 2 problem 3 score. So if for any reason you did poorly on midterm 1 problem 4 you have a chance to make that up by doing well on problem 3 of midterm 2.

2023-10-10T17:32:52Z	"Midterm 1 UPDATED P4 and P5 Grades Problems 4 and 5 have been regraded with revised graders that correct some deficiencies in the original grading.  The new grading reports and updated SUMMARY are in your handback directories.

For problem 4:
The grader now allows the helper function to precede the primary function. That’s not the way our style would normally do it, but it can be reasonable so we allowed it.The grader no longer requires the thoroughness criteria for the helper function to be achieved in the primary function tests.  Only the helper function tests must be called with enough gifts (4) to have 2 balls and 2 blocks
 
For problem 5:
The 5 grader now works properly for cases where the check-expects include floating point numbers. This required relaxing validity requirements and thoroughness testing both.The grader accepts 3 combinations of Integer and Number in the signature.

The new stats for the exam as a whole are:

2023-10-10T17:24:24Z	"Midterm 1 Grades &amp; Info We have tried to get midterm 1 grades back to you as quickly as possible so that all of you have feedback, and some of you who may need to do some review before next week have time to do this weekend.
 
Please respect the time of everyone on Piazza and read this entire message thoroughly before asking any questions about midterm grading. Questions about midterm grading must be asked as a follow up to this post and, to minimize clutter in the thread, questions that are answered by this post may be deleted rather than replied to. 

Overall, the class did very well, which is typical of midterm 1. We were pleased to see that very few students submitted files with errors that prevented them from being graded, this is a welcome change from prior terms.
 There are several sections below, including:

Feedback on Individual Problems 
Problem 1 
This problem assessed your understanding of the technical terminology used in the course. Knowing proper technical terminology is important as we go forward because as we talk about more complex programs and understanding what we are saying will depend on knowing the terminology. 
 
If you did not do well on this question, please review the course glossary, which is linked from the links page https://cs110.students.cs.ubc.ca/admin/links.html 
 
Problem 2 
This problem assessed your understanding of the step-by-step evaluation rules. 
The most common mistakes were: 
Skipping a step Replacing constant names with values all at once rather than when evaluation reaches the constant name. Not replacing parameters with values all at once. 

If you did not do well on this question, please review the step-by-step evaluation rules. You can find them on the language page, by following the link on the links page https://cs110.students.cs.ubc.ca/admin/links.html. As we write more complex programs it will be critical that you understand exactly how evaluation works in order to understand some of the key techniques we will use. 
 
Problem 3 
This problem assessed your understanding of how to construct data driven templates using the dd template rules. This material is critical because you will soon need to be able to construct these templates in a more on-the-fly fashion. 
Some mistakes we saw were: 
Not following the order of the type comment Not guarding the two calls to string=? Not having the right number of arguments to string=? Not using else as the last answer Adding extra cond cases. 
If you did not do well on this question, please review the dd-templates part of the full Design Recipes (not just the checklist). 
 
Problem 4 
This problem assessed your understanding of using the HtDF recipe, working with multiple data definitions, and following the reference rule to design a helper function. 
 
There was confusion here caused by inconsistencies in the order of width, length, and height. That was our mistake, and we apologize for it. To handle that, we carefully designed the grader to accept as correct any Dimension that included all the correct numbers. It did not matter what order width, length, and height were in, and it did not matter if the orders got scrambled up between the various kinds of gifts and the dimensions. As long as the right three numbers made it into the Dimension we took the answer as correct. With this change in place we were happy to see that the class did very well on this problem. 
 
The most common mistakes were: 
Failing to use a helper function Errors in the signature of the main or helper function. Not having sufficiently thorough tests by making sure that there was more than one ball and more than one block in the tests. 
 
If you did not do well on this question, please very carefully review the raining eggs lecture problem. You should also take the exam problem you submitted to office hours as soon as possible. This problem is probably the most indicative in terms of your readines for the upcoming modules. It is very important you master this material right away; before Tuesday’s lecture if possible. 
 
Problem 5 
This problem assessed your understanding of using the HtDF recipe on a list of atomic data. There was an unintended bit of trickiness in this problem which is that odd? raises an error if it is called on a non-integer. With that in mind we accepted all the following signatures for the function:  
(@signature ListOfNumber -&gt; Number) 
(@signature ListOfNumber -&gt; Integer) 
(@signature ListOfInteger -&gt; Integer) 
 
The class did very well ... 
If you did not do well on this question, please review the module 4a lecture starters right away, and reach out for help on Piazza or office hours right away. We will be using lists and recursion in most problems the rest of the term, so you need to be completely comfortable with this material. 
 
 
What Getting a Low Grade Means 
It is important to keep in mind that the course is about to pick up in both speed and complexity. Please take the feedback you are receiving from this exam as useful information going into the rest of the course.  
 
70 - 80 Spend time carefully reviewing the exam and working through problems to correct the misconceptions you demonstrated. 
 
60 - 70 We encourage you to attend TA or instructor office hours as soon as you can this coming week. At these office hours ask the course staff to review your exam and your work to date. They will be able to help you develop a plan for getting caught up. You have to work at least 2 hours extra each day this week to get caught up.  
 
For grades below 60, a great deal of work will be required during the next week to succeed in the remainder of the course. Please do not wait to get help, instead reach out to the instructor or on Piazza ASAP so we can help you plan. 

Viewing Your Exam  
The auto-graded exams are now available in your handback directory. There is also a summary report in the SUMMARY folder in your handback directory. 

Regrade Requests 
We will share another announcement on Piazza about regrade requests shortly. Do not contact the course team via email or post on Piazza about regrade requests until we make that post. All messages and posts about regrading that are sent before our announcement will be deleted."	795

There&#39;s a bug in the current spd.plt file that causes it to give a very confusing error message for malformed signatures like (@signature Foo -&gt;Bar) or (@signature Foo Bar).  The message is confusing enough that we want to fix this before the midterm.   We don&#39;t want anyone to get this very confusing error message during the exam, because we will not be able to help you then.

2023-09-29T22:31:04Z	"Lab Fine Tuning You may have noticed that myself and some of our most senior TAs have been dropping in on lab lately. We are not there to check up on you; we are not there to check up on the TAs either. Instead, we are there because we are always monitoring different aspects of the course to see how they are going and how they might be improved.  Labs are a special focus for us because they are the place where you can get the most one-on-one contact with course staff.  Based on our visits, we want to make some changes that will mean the TAs can spend more time giving you direct feedback on your lab work.  With that goal in mind, you can expect to see some changes in how labs operate, starting as soon as today.
Long problem set assessments will move more quickly.  The TAs will be asking the next person in line to be ready and waiting to start. They will also be conducting the assessment itself more quickly.  We have asked them to ask you the questions, assess your answers, and give you very brief feedback on the assessment.  If you have further questions you want to ask about the problem set please take those to office hours. We anticipate this will free up about 45 minutes of TA time to help with your lab work.Short problem set assessments will also move more quickly.  Instead of coming around to you TAs will also call your name out. They will go in a set order so you can know when your turn is coming up.  Please go to the TA quickly.  Expect them to ask you one question, ask for an answer, and record their assessment. Again, they will briefly tell you the assessment, but that will not be a time to discuss the problem set.  We expect this will also free up significant TA time to help with your lab.Finally, the way the TAs walk around the room will change.  They will move through the room in order, asking to see parts of your work, making suggestions, and asking you questions about it. They will not be responding to questions with raised hands. Instead, when you have a problem we want you to practice working it out yourself just as you on a problem set or exam.  The next time they get to your seat they may make a suggestion that will help you find the problem.We know you may prefer to have the TA spend extended time with you solving a problem you are having. But the goal we have set for the TAs is not to help you finish the lab, it is to help you do well on the final exam. To do that you need them to help you learn to work systematically, and learn the techniques that can help you solve problems on your own – it is not good for your learning for the TAs to dig deeply into debugging your designs.
 We know from experience that it will help your learning if the TAs can make more frequent suggestions about how you are working. We hope that these adjustments we are making will help with that.  Please let us know over the next few weeks how you think it is going. "	551

2023-09-27T16:43:50Z	Switching to iClicker Cloud THIS MESSAGE IS IMPORTANT AND TIME CRITICAL.We are always trying to simplify the 110 learning platform with the goal of making things easier for students.This term we tried to use Zoom polls because we thought that since you were already using Zoom, it would be one less platform for you to have to login to.We tried to make that work.  Specifically Emily tried really really hard.But to say it hasn&#39;t worked out well is an understatement.So, at this point we are switching gears and going back to iClicker.WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT:  - We will do iClicker polls on Thursday &#34;for practice&#34;  - We will do iClicker polls that count for course marks next Tuesday.Please consult https://lthub.ubc.ca/guides/iclicker-cloud-student-guide/which explains what you have to do in order to answer iClicker polls.NOTE - please DO THE ABOVE TODAY OR TOMORROW, so that you are ready for Thursday&#39;s practice run.  If you fail to try and set things up for Thursday and then have problems on Tuesday we will not be able to grant concession for those problems.	505

2023-09-30T01:56:37Z	"Lab 4 and Lab 5 Schedule Reminder During the 2023W1 term, statutory holidays have created an imbalance in the numbers of days available for classes on each weekday, with Mondays disproportionately affected.

If you submitted a conflict form for either of the midterms and no longer have a conflict due to the time change, your conflict form submission has been deleted and you do not need to do anything other than attend the exam at the regularly scheduled time.

You must complete the CPSC 110 Midterm 1 Conflict Form before 11:59 PM PST on Monday, September 25 if you require academic concession to write Midterm 1 at an alternate time due to conflicting responsibilities, medical circumstances, or compassionate grounds. See UBC&#39;s policy on academic concession for examples and exceptions. Do not submit a conflict form if your CPSC 110 lab conflicts with the exam time as there are no CPSC 110 labs scheduled on the day of the exam.

Students who are registered with the Centre for Accessibility must register through the CFA exam portal at least 1 week before the exam to receive exam accommodations. Because the CFA exam centre closes at 9:30 PM, students who register to write their exam at the CFA exam centre will write their exam from 5:00-7:00 PM on Friday, October 6 (with any applicable extended time accommodations applied)."	425

Piazza also provides an opportunity for those of you who want to improve your learning by answering other students&#39; questions. Observing how well students ask and answer questions on Piazza helps the course team choose TAs for future terms.
 
Please keep in mind that there are 1,300&#43; of us asking and answering questions on Piazza. The volume of questions adds up quickly and we&#39;d like to avoid duplicate questions as much as possible. You should always check the syllabus, the schedule, and make use of Piazza&#39;s search function before asking a question. If you have a question about a specific DrRacket function (e.g. overlay), please look it up in the DrRacket help desk before posting on Piazza.
 
Guidelines you must follow when posting on Piazza:
Do not post screenshots of text or code. This includes program text and auto-grader feedback. Do not post an image of it, do not post a link to it, do not post the section number it came from. Post the actual text together with any other information the person answering the question might need. By posting the actual program text you make it easy for someone who wants to answer your question to quickly copy it, paste it into DrRacket, and work on it. By posting the extra information you save the person answering from having to go find what you already have right in front of you.Format code properly. In the Piazza editor there is a button labeled &#34;code.&#34; If you press that button and then paste your code into the editor, it should be formatted properly. You may need to clean up the indentation though, and if so then please take the time to do it.Take the time to say what you have done so far and what your current understanding is. Often times you will find that the act of writing that out will clarify things for you, and then you have your answer right away without having to wait. This also provides a good foundation for figuring things out in exams when there is no help. But even if explaining your current understanding doesn&#39;t clear things up right away, it will provide a better foundation for us to answer your question, and a better foundation for you to incorporate the answer.
 
Again, we encourage you to use Piazza as your go to resource for getting answers to your questions about the course. Just take a few moments each time you post to invest in good karma by formatting and asking your question in a way that makes it clear to everyone reading it."	215

Some people have said they missed the music that we didn’t get to have for the last few lectures.  And I’m aware some other people weren’t interested at all!
 
With New Year’s in mind here’s one last bit of music - this is from the Closing of Winterland, December 31 1978. 
 
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryHatTtaSn4
 
For context, from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winterland_Ballroom
 

During Winterland&#39;s final month of existence, shows were booked nearly every night. Acts included The Tubes,[9] Ramones, Smokey Robinson, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, and on December 15–16, 1978, Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band. Springsteen&#39;s December 15 show was simulcast on local radio station KSAN-FM.
Winterland closed on New Year&#39;s Eve 1978 / New Year&#39;s Day 1979 with a concert by the Grateful Dead, New Riders of the Purple Sage, and The Blues Brothers. The show lasted for over eight hours, with the Grateful Dead&#39;s performance—documented on DVD and CD as The Closing of Winterland—lasting nearly six hours, beginning at midnight with Bill Graham&#39;s favorite Dead tune, Sugar Magnolia. After the show, the crowd was treated to a hot, buffet-style breakfast. The final show was simulcast on radio station KSAN-FM and also broadcast live on the local PBS TV station KQED.[10]

 
The song I chose above is from close to the end of the Dead’s second set – I don’t have an exact timeline but figure sometime like 4 am.  This was one heck of a New Year’s Eve show.  I’m too young to have been at this, but I went to a number of Bill Graham produced New Year’s Eve Grateful Dead concerts in the 1980s.  Some were excellent, but they were all over by 2am - the legendary days of concerts lasting till 6am were long over by then.
 
Enjoy. (Or not of course.)

Oh, Gregor, professor, with fervent zeal,Thy lectures danced, a scholarly reel.In the tapestry of knowledge, thou didst weave,A symphony of truths, thy students to relieve.
With patience vast as oceans&#39; endless tide,Thy guidance flowed, a mentor by our side.In every lesson, wisdom&#39;s seeds were sown,A harvest rich, a scholar&#39;s garden grown.
&#34;Trust the natural recursion,&#34; thou didst declare,A mantra whispered through the hallowed air.In algorithms of the mind, we found,The beauty of thy teachings, so profound.
As roots entwine in nature&#39;s sacred dance,So too did knowledge, in thy class advance.Each concept built upon the one before,A structure sturdy, a mental temple&#39;s core.
Thy words, a beacon in the scholarly night,Illuminating paths of intellectual light.In the recursive maze, we found our way,Trusting the patterns that thy lessons lay.
Oh, Gregor, like a compass true and sure,Thy guidance led us, evermore.In the vast expanse of academia&#39;s sea,Thy teachings echoed, a beacon to be.
So here I pen, in Shakespearean verse,A tribute to thee, as prose disperse.In the annals of learning, thy name shall shine,Oh, Gregor, professor, a guide divine."	1750

I hope you're doing well during exam season. I know you must be eager to find out your average grades for your courses. To assist you with that, I have created a grade calculator that can calculate your grades for any course, not just 110. It's very user-friendly and takes into account all the essential factors, including the number of grades that can be dropped. So, go ahead and give it a try!

For example:

Here, I defined a non-existent course, ""CPSC109,"" which has sections with their names, weights, # of lowest grades that can be dropped, and lists of grades.

I won't be going too much into the meat of it. Feel free to explore for yourself.

NOTE:
;;
;;  There is NO REASON FOR THIS TO BE TAIL RECURSIVE.  The tail recursive
;;  solution is challenging.  We strongly encourage you NOT TO DO A TAIL
;;  recursive version.
;;
;; BUT: If you hand in a CORRECT tail recursive version we will award 
;;      bonus marks to your final exam score worth 15% of the weight of
;;      this question .  On the other hand, an incorrect tail recursive
;;      version will not earn any extra marks or special consideration
;;      because you tried the more difficult thing.



I managed to make it work in structural recursion and then went onto to try to make my solution tail recursive, after spending a fair bit of time struggling and not knowing what was wrong, i looked at the solution and realised they use a tandem worklist solution, does this mean there is no way to make it tail recursive without using tandem workslists? (dont really understand how and when tandem worklists are used)I am attaching below a code snippet of my structural recursion solution, my attempt at making it tail recursive and the actual tail recursive solution.

thank you for your time if you read through and were able to provide some advice.

Complete the design of the function below.

In this problem you must design a function, that for a given tree, produces
a list of the names of nodes for which the immediate parent branch has an
odd number.

For greater certainty, we are giving you 4 check-expects, which you must
not edit. You may add additional check-expects if you like.

(tree-names-on-odd-branches TA) produces empty, because starting at TA
all by itself it is not on any branch at all, so it is definitely not on
an odd branch.

On the other hand, (tree-names-on-odd-branches TFOO) produces (list &#34;A&#34;),
because starting at TFOO, TA is on an odd branch. TB is not.

The remaining tests are correct.

Your answer must include @template-origin and a correct function definition.
There is absolutely no reason to make this function tail recursive.  Instead
you should use ordinary structural recursion. A correct tail recursive version
will receive far fewer marks.

NOTE: This problem will be autograded, and ALL OF THE FOLLOWING ARE ESSENTIAL
      IN YOUR SOLUTION.  Failure to follow these requirements may result in
      receiving zero marks for this problem.

 - The function you design MUST BE CALLED tree-names-on-odd-branches
 
 - You MUST use the encapsulated templates above.
 
 - You MUST NOT RENAME any of the local functions within those templates.
 
 - You MUST NOT RENAME any of the parameters of those local functions.
 
 - You MUST USE ALL of the local functions within those templates.

 - You MUST NOT EDIT above the line marked with ***.
 
 - You MUST NOT COMMENT out any @ metadata tags.
 
 - The file MUST NOT have any errors when the Check Syntax button is pressed.
   Press Check Syntax and Run often, and correct any errors early.
 
 - You MUST FOLLOW all applicable design rules.

In this case, we have mutually referential data. The autograder suggests that the selectors for a tree should only be used in fn-for-t. 
In general, when working with data definitions involving reference, is it best practice to only work with data of a specific type in its own function (in this case, fn-for-t)? "	1705

Design the function below.

The function consumes two binary trees and produces true if they are equal.
Note that this problem will not be hand-graded, but you should treat it as a
two-one-of problem and sketch out a cross-product of type comments table
anyways.

Your answer must include @signature, purpose, appropriate check-expects,
@template-origin and a correct function definition.

After you finish the rest of the exam, if you have time, come back and think 
very carefully about test argument thoroughness.  There are a surprising
number of cases.

NOTE: This problem will be autograded, and ALL OF THE FOLLOWING ARE ESSENTIAL
      IN YOUR SOLUTION.  Failure to follow these requirements may result in
      receiving zero marks for this problem.

 - The function you design MUST BE CALLED btree-equal?
 - You MUST NOT EDIT the provided @htdf tag.

contrary to the given diagram, the order of the packages in search state is not preserved.



if the order was to be preserved, the package sizes would be in order 1, 2, 3, 4. However, the next-search states has changed them.


(it&#39;s done here, as the gift is simply removed as opposed to updated and it&#39;s new counterpart is slapped on the front of the list as opposed to where it was in the original order).

Unless the student were to implement next-search-states almost identically to how it was in the solution, we would lose many marks over this (despite being able to produce the solution, just in a different order, or rather should I say, the correct order, as indicated on the diagram).

Can anyone provide any explanation to why next-search-state order suddenly doesn&#39;t matter?

2023-12-13T07:20:17Z	"Problem-bank Programming contest I am not good at search, especially design the generative part. So I took this problem to practice. 
The solution used a very beautiful way to solve the problem, but I don&#39;t think I could think of that on my own. I was trying to use this apporach to design my program:

initialize search state -&gt; generate next states -&gt; go through next states and rule out invaild ones -&gt; combine the results.

Specifically,
initialize search state: generate the plan state with empty numbers except adding all the problems as list to decide.
generate next states: take the first element to decide ande make 2 states: skipped and move.
go through next states: fn-for-list to navigate the list and append the results.
rule out invalid ones: check each plan state, and only add valid states to my list.

Here is my code, but it doesn&#39;t seem to generate next states correctly, because my function only returns plans when 1 question is enough to meet both criteria. Can anyone tell me what did I do wrong?

                      (odd? (branch-num b))))]

    (fn-for-t t0 #f)))
```

This is my solution, and according to me, it's perfect. Its flawless. Its beautiful. But it doesn't work :-(
```

  ;; odd-tree: (listof String) ;; list of tree names in odd branch

                (fn-for-t (branch-tree b) odd-tree)))]

    (fn-for-t t0 empty)))
```
Instead it produces:
```

differs from (list ""FOO"" ""A"" ""C""), the expected value.

I wrote that there were 2 definitions lifted, which were:

(define (addx_0 n) (&#43; n 2))
(define (addx_1 n) (&#43; n 1))
But after checking with the solution, it turns out that there are 3 definitions lifted:

(define (addx_0 n) (&#43; n 2))
(define (addx_1 n) (&#43; n 1))
(define (addx_2 n) (&#43; n 0))
So addx is lifted a third time because the main boo function is called 3 times, even though the third evaluation of boo results in (zero? x) producing true, which means that addx won&#39;t even be called. The definitions in the local are lifted whenever the function is called, even if they aren&#39;t going to be used.
Can someone check if my understanding is correct?

I was just reviewing the lecture starter file and was wondering why Q1 (solve) has encapsulated in the template-origin whilst Q2 (find-path) does not have encapsulated in the template-origin. I understand that an accumulator already indicates that an encapsulation is a part of it. The question I&#39;m kind of asking is when should I write encapsulation in the template-origin, and to be more specific, especially when there is an accumulator in the template origin as well... or did the solution file have a typo? Thanks.

            (fn-for-t (branch-tree b) path))]

    (fn-for-lob (tree-branches t0) (tree-name t0))))

And I was getting a result like this (which makes sense, as I was using path):
```

In a graph that has joins, we need to use Structurual Recursion to find the shortest path from the start point to the destination. 

By finding the shortest path, the question implies we need to try all possible paths and compare the sum of the steps, and give the one corresponding to the least steps. 

My understanding of structural recursion tells me if I reach my desination, I would immediately return the result. However, in this situation I would never have a chance to try other options and compare the results. Can anyone tell me why the structura; resursion works in this situation?

Although in the practice exam it does not ask us to actually solve this problem but I tried to, and I don&#39;t know how to solve it without a worklist.

#|
In this starter file you must write a complete design for the
find-increasing-path-sr function.

This function must use structural recursion. It consumes a from room name and
a to room name. It searches the graph for a path starting at the from room,
going to the to room, and where each Stairs taken must have at least one more
steps than the previous stairs.  If there is no path, it produces false. 
Otherwise, for the first such path it finds, it produces a list of the
Stairs labels on the path starting with the first Stairs and ending with the
last Stairs.

You must provide a complete HtDF function design below. For maximum credit
your function should run properly and pass all submitted and additional
tests.

2023-12-12T06:44:18Z	"Accumulators P4 from Problem Bank Hi! I&#39;m working on Accumulators P4 from the problem bank, and it asks to make a tail-recursive function, so I just wanna clarify some things on making a function tail-recursive.

This is my function definition:

(define (average lon0)
  ;; sum is Number; sum so far
  (local [(define (fn-for-lon lon sum)
            (cond [(empty? lon) sum]
                  [else
                   (fn-for-lon (rest lon) (&#43; (first lon) sum))]))]

    (/ (fn-for-lon lon0 0) (length lon0))))

And this is the function definition from the solution:

(define (average lon)
  ;; cnt: Number; how many numbers so far 
  ;; sum: Number; sum of numbers so far  
  ;;
  ;; (average (list 2 3 4)  0 0)
  ;; (average (list   3 4)  1 2)
  ;; (average (list     4)  2 5)
  ;; (average (list      )  3 9) 
  (local[(define (average lon cnt sum)
           (cond [(empty? lon) (/ sum cnt)]

                  (average (rest lon) (add1 cnt)
                           (&#43; (first lon) sum))]))]
    (average lon 0 0)))  

I&#39;m wondering particularly about why the solution had to use the cnt accumulator. Is it necessary to use cnt if I can use (length lon0) instead? And another thing, does the final result HAVE to be in the base case? Can&#39;t I manipulate the result from the base case in the trampoline instead (just like what I did in my solution)? Or will that make the function not tail-recursive?

Edit:
For example, in 2023S-p3, it asked us to design a function, that for a given tree, produces a list of the names of nodes for which the immediate parent branch has an odd number. We have the lines below as instructions. 
- You MUST use the encapsulated templates above.  - You MUST NOT RENAME any of the local functions within those templates.  - You MUST NOT RENAME any of the parameters of those local functions.  - You MUST USE ALL of the local functions within those templates.

When we use an accumulator, it is in a different template and we add parameters to the given template. Could we still use the accumulator in this case?"	1632

*** PART B ***
Consider the design of a function called total-hours-tr.  The first part
of the function design looks like this:

(@htdf total-hours-tr)
(@signature Challenge -&gt; Natural)
;; total hours to complete this challenge, including its subtasks/subchallenges
(check-expect (total-hours-tr C1) 0)
(check-expect (total-hours-tr C2) 24)
(check-expect (total-hours-tr C3) 31)
(check-expect (total-hours-tr C4) 46)

The function definition MUST BE TAIL RECURSIVE.

Using the design methods in this course, should this function definition be
written using any accumulators?

To answer, first replace &#34;???&#34; in PART-B-YES/NO with &#34;yes&#34; or &#34;no&#34;.

|#

(define PART-B-YES/NO &#34;yes&#34;) ;replace &#34;???&#34; with &#34;yes&#34; or &#34;no&#34;

#|

If you put &#34;no&#34; then you are done with Part B, go on to Part C.

If it should be written using accumulators, then for each of these four specific
kinds of accumulator below we want to know whether that specific kind of
accumulator is needed and why:

- worklist
- one or more tandem worklists
- visited
- rsf

The possible reasons why are:

1 - to store unvisited children of visited nodes
2 - to store the total hours seen so far
3 - to store challenges with more tasks than their parent
4 - to store parent challenge name
5 - to break cycles
6 - to handle joins
7 - to accumulate information along paths in the data
8 - to accumulate information along tail recursive calls

To answer replace each ??? in PART-B with either 0 to indicate that specific
kind of accumulator is not necessary; or put an integer from 1-8 to indicate
that the accumulator is necessary for the specific reason from the numbered
list above.
|#

(define PART-B-WORKLIST 1)          ;replace every ??? with integer 0-8
(define PART-B-TANDEM-WORKLIST/S 0)
(define PART-B-VISITED 7)
(define PART-B-RSF 2)
These are my answers for Part B

However  these are the correct answers 

(define PART-B-WORKLIST 1)          ;replace every ??? with integer 0-8
(define PART-B-TANDEM-WORKLIST/S 0)
(define PART-B-VISITED 0)
(define PART-B-RSF 8)


I don&#39;t understand why we do choose rsf to accumulate information along tail recursive calls when we need to produce a value, why wouldn&#39;t it be 2?"	1625

2023-12-11T05:09:54Z	"2022 w1 F p3 when to use path or visited In part 2b and 2d, both of the functions are tail recursive, however the autograder says that both of them use a path accumulator and not a visited accumulator. I was wondering why this is as I thought that the rule was that for tail recursive functions we use a visited accumulator and for structural recursive functions we use a path accumulator? Part 2b says: &#34;This function must use tail recursion. It consumes a starting node name and produces a list of the names of all nodes that have a size greater than the previous node in the traversal. Note that some nodes are reachable from more than one prior node, so a node not included because of one prior node might be included because of another prior node.&#34;

Part 2d says: &#34;This function must use tail recursion. It consumes a starting node name, a destination node name and produces the first path to the destination if found or fails otherwise.&#34;

2023-12-11T02:33:02Z	"m11-out-of-order Clarification on Visited Hi everyone,

I was hoping to get some clarification on what the value of &#34;visited&#34; should be when we are initializing it in our trampoline. I noticed that most of our examples up till now had it as &#34;empty&#34;, which made sense since our invariant for this accumulator was usually the previously visited nodes. Therefore, if we haven&#39;t visited any nodes yet, our list would be empty. 

However, in the lecture starter m11-out-of-order, it mentions that (first visited) is always the previously visited node in the tree, therefore it can never be empty. So we instead make our trampoline call fn-for-lonn and initialize visited as (list num0) rather than &#34;empty&#34;.

I&#39;m a bit confused on whether this means we should have been initializing visited this way in all of our previous examples, since it will always be the previously visited nodes in a tree?

I would truly appreciate any help/clarification! Thank you. "	1596

(fn-for-t t0 #f)

Here is the official solution:


(define (tree-names-on-odd-branches t0)
  ;; odd-branch? is Boolean
  ;; true if the immediately preceding branch had an odd number
  ;; false otherwise
  (local [(define (fn-for-t t odd-branch?)

                      (odd? (branch-num b))))]

    (fn-for-t t0 #f)))

For my solution I used a different invariant:

;; pnum is Natural; number of current parent branch

and the trampoline:
(fn-for-t t0 0)

Here&#39;s my solution:


(define (tree-names-on-odd-branches t0)
  ;; pnum is Natural; number of current parent branch
  (local [(define (fn-for-t t pnum)
            (if (odd? pnum)
                (cons (tree-name t) (fn-for-lob (tree-branches t) pnum))
                (fn-for-lob (tree-branches t) pnum)))
          
          (define (fn-for-lob lob pnum)
            (cond [(empty? lob) empty]
                  [else
                   (append (fn-for-branch (first lob) pnum)
                           (fn-for-lob (rest lob) pnum))]))
          
          (define (fn-for-branch b pnum)
            (fn-for-t (branch-tree b) (branch-num b)))]

I could see a possible dock in marks coming from my solution&#39;s trampoline being less straightforward than the official one however both trampolines go by the same logic of never having an odd parent branch for the initial tree as (odd? 0) will always evaluate to false. 

I was still able to get 100 on the autograder using this solution but I wanted to ask if a working, alternate invariant would still result in full marks on an exam as I do understand my solution may be less readable.

2023-12-10T23:14:46Z	"Visited vs Path (Went through other questions on Piazza) I have been studying and trying to understand the difference between Visited and Path accumulators. I went through questions on Piazza and lecture recordings. What I understand is that

visited acc: All nodes we went through on tail-recursion which prevents cycles and joins

path acc: All nodes we went through on structural recursion which only prevents cycles.

I believe understand the basic idea of them but as I am solving practice exams, (may be due to tandem worklist problems), I feel lost on when to use one of them.

I feel if it is a tail recursion, we should always use visited.. is it correct?
and we use tail recursion when we need to prevent joins..right?

Below is a solve function I coded for m09-search-triangle-solitaire-starter, but the code never stops from running. I later found out that we had to define the two functions, valid-jumps and do-jumps, inside the all-next-bd function as a local function. I don&#39;t understand why it is necessary to define it inside a local function. The call to valid-jumps and do-jumps do happen even if they are in the same level, right? I&#39;m assuming that it has something to do with the fact that both of these functions are consuming Jump (which is different from Board) as their argument, but I&#39;m not sure.

For future reference, when we&#39;re referring to the &#34;traversal&#34; of a graph, would it be the dynamic flow of the tail recursion (last thing visited in time), or the static structure of the tree (structural recursion)? Please help. Thanks!


PART 2B
This function must use tail recursion. It consumes a starting node name and
produces a list of the names of all nodes that have a size greater than the
previous node in the traversal. Note that some nodes are reachable from more
than one prior node, so a node not included because of one prior node might be
included because of another prior node.

2023-12-09T23:37:55Z	"Problem Bank: Replicate-Elm question Hi there, 

I managed to figure out the solution to this problem but I&#39;m still really confused how its working... This was the code I wrote:


(define (replicate-elm lox0 n)
  ;; Counter is Natural ; Number of times (first lox) will be replicated
  ;;                      starting at n and decreasing by 1 each time
  (local [(define (fn-for-lox lox counter)

                             (fn-for-lox lox (sub1 counter))))]))]
    (fn-for-lox lox0 n)))
I honestly put (rest lox) as the true case of my if expression by sheer curiosity since I knew I couldn&#39;t keep it as lox, otherwise my list would never get shorter and thus I&#39;d have an endless loop.

However, I don&#39;t understand how I&#39;m not already stuck in some sort of loop considering my false calse is cons-ing the first element multiple times before I look at the rest of the list. Wouldn&#39;t my list still get bigger and bigger each time I look at the rest of it with all the new elements tagged onto the front of it? 

I did try to write the examples for my accumulator but was really confused how to do it considering my solution was a larger list, rather than a smaller one. And I knew I wasn&#39;t really supposed to use a &#34;result so far&#34; accumulator or tail recursion to answer this question. 

I feel like I&#39;ve suddently forgotten how recursions work and thats whats causing a lot of my trouble lol

;; Using the following data definition:
;;
;; a) Design a function that consumes a room and a map produces a list of the
;;    names of all the rooms reachable from that room.
;;
;; b) Revise your function from (a) to make it tail recursive. 
;;


;; =================
;; Data Definitions: 

(@htdd Room)
(define-struct room (name exits))
;; Room is (make-room String (listof String))
;; interp. the room&#39;s name, and list of names of rooms that the exits lead to


(@htdd Map)
;; A Map is AN OPAQUE DATA STRUCTURE. OPAQUE means you can&#39;t look inside it.
;; THE ONLY THING YOU ARE  ALLOWED TO DO WITH IT IS PASS IT TO GET-ROOM.
;;
;; The bottom of the file defines a map called ROOMS for this graph:
;;
;; https://cs110.students.cs.ubc.ca/bank/H4.png
;;
;; But the function you design must work with any map.

I worked on this problem and got the function to work, but it turned out that my check-expects were wrong, so I&#39;m a bit confused about the order of traversal through this graph (attached below).

Initially I had my check-expects like this: 


(check-expect (all-reachable (lookup-room &#34;A&#34; ROOMS) ROOMS)
              (list &#34;A&#34; &#34;B&#34; &#34;C&#34; &#34;E&#34; &#34;D&#34; &#34;F&#34;))
(check-expect (all-reachable (lookup-room &#34;C&#34; ROOMS) ROOMS)
              (list &#34;C&#34; &#34;B&#34; &#34;E&#34; &#34;A&#34; &#34;D&#34; &#34;F&#34;))
but the actual result produced is:


(check-expect (all-reachable (lookup-room &#34;A&#34; ROOMS) ROOMS)
              (list &#34;A&#34; &#34;B&#34; &#34;C&#34; &#34;E&#34; &#34;F&#34; &#34;D&#34;))
(check-expect (all-reachable (lookup-room &#34;C&#34; ROOMS) ROOMS)
              (list &#34;C&#34; &#34;B&#34; &#34;E&#34; &#34;F&#34; &#34;A&#34; &#34;D&#34;))

Looking at the graph, it seems that the function would go to A, then B, then C which goes back to B, which then goes to E, then back to A to D, then E and finally F, producing (list &#34;A&#34; &#34;B&#34; &#34;C&#34; &#34;E&#34; &#34;D&#34; &#34;F&#34;).
If anyone could clarify this for me that&#39;ll be great.

Now this code works as its supposed to and it makes more sense to me than the posted solution.

However the order in which the list is made is different as follows but the content is the same. As far as the question is concerned it fulfills the purpose so how would these type of questions be graded if autograder can&#39;t account for the order of the items in the list?

None of the TAs could explain what this error is, so I thought I&#39;d post this here to get some ideas.

------------

EDIT: thx for the reminder, below is my function and my explanation, pls corrrect me if there&#39;s anything I misunderstood that caused the error above:
So what I did was I had two accumulators, one to keep track of the path I would take to reach the destination (lostw) and one to keep track of the venues visited (visited).

Starting with fn-for-venue, if the venue name is the same as the given venue, it would produce the lostw (most likely to be empty since we&#39;re there right away). If the given venue is in the list of visited venues, it would produce false since we&#39;ve gone there already. Otherwise we&#39;d pass the listof Streetway to fn-for-los.

For fn-for-los, if the listof Streetway is empty, we will produce false because there is no way to get to the destination. Otherwise, I have a locally defined try that takes the first of listof Streetway, the combination of the path needed to get to the destination &#43; the name of the first streetway, and the visited venues and performs fn-for-sw on those parameters. If the result of try is true, then produce that result. If not, then I self-recurse with the rest of the streetways and do it again.

Finally for fn-for-sw, it goes through what fn-for-venue does, but this time with the destination (first lookup-venue will find that destination), the path it takes to get to that destination, and the venues visited.

;; Position is Natural

Looking at P2, it says that the lower left corner of a 4x4 board would be 15, but i cant seem to make a board with 0 in the top left and 15 in the bottom left work in my data analysis. I added my understanding of what a 4x4 board should look like, but it doesn&#39;t align with P2. Is this an error in the data definition?

This function must use tail recursion. It consumes a from room name and
a to room name. It searches the graph for a path starting at the from room,
going to the to room, and where each stairs taken must have at least one more
steps than the previous stairs.  It there is no such path it produces false. 
Otherwise, it finds the path with the fewest number of steps, and for that 
path it produces the stairs labels on the path starting with the first stairs
and ending with the last stairs.

#|

In the following partially complete function design:

 - The next-ps function has been updated so to produce all valid
   moves chosen from up, down, left, and right of the given position.

 - ONE set of templates for fn-for-p and fn-for-lop uses ordinary recursion.

 - ONE set of templates for fn-for-p and fn-for-lop uses tail recursion.

 - Neither set of templates have accumulators to prevent cycling.

Complete the design of the function below. Note carefully that this 
function produces a natural if there is a path starting at 0,0 that first
passes through start, and then passes through end. The natural is the number
of steps from from start to end.  If there is no such path it fails.

Start by figuring out what addtional accumulator(s) you need and then
choose normal or tail recursion. Work with the right set of templates
and delete or comment out the others.

NOTE THAT WE HAVE PUT A USEFUL DATA DEFINITION AND A HELPER FUNCTION
CALLED distance-add1 in for you.

2023-12-06T05:54:32Z	Remove Cooldown for practice exams Is it possible to remove the autograder cooldown for practice exams? As we are approaching the exam, we would like to get in as much practice as possible. The one hour cooldown makes it so (if we find a problem with our code right away after handing in), we have to wait a whole hour to submit again and see if we found the mistake. I understand the cooldown for problem sets (as we shouldn&#39;t be spamming the autograder) but for a practice exam, it may be beneficial to remove or at least reduce the cooldown time (maybe to 10 minutes like the labs).	1487

They have to take time later in the day to watch the lecture, and they can&#39;t ask questions during the lecture.  This is especially frustrating since IT also messed up the Zoom room size the first day of class.

So I&#39;m going to make an additional accommodation -- that will apply to both sections:

- The first part of today&#39;s lecture, on an alternate way of representing graphs is material everyone needs to learn.  You&#39;ll need it for the problem set, and it will be considered as examinable material.

- BUT, tandem worklists will not be on this term&#39;s final exam.  It&#39;s a neat idea though, and the presentation of it in today&#39;s lecture is the simplest we&#39;ve ever done. So if you have time do look at it."	1484

This code is from edX Video Accumulator same-house-as-parent.

Problem:
In the Harry Potter movies, it is very important which of the four houses awizard is placed in when they are at Hogwarts. This is so important that in most families multiple generations of wizards are all placed in the same family. 
Design a representation of wizard family trees that includes, for each wizard,their name, the house they were placed in at Hogwarts and their children. Weencourage you to get real information for wizard families from:    http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page
The reason we do this is that designing programs often involves collectiondomain information from a variety of sources and representing it in the programas constants of some form. So this problem illustrates a fairly common scenario.
That said, for reasons having to do entirely with making things fit on thescreen in later videos, we are going to use the following wizard family tree,in which wizards and houses both have 1 letter names. (Sigh)

PROBLEM:
Design a function that consumes a wizard and produces the names of every wizard in the tree that was placed in the same house as their immediateparent.

The same thing is happening in my own file (although my function is structured differently so that may be why). Does anyone know why this is? I thought it was because it&#39;s counting rooms that are a part of the loop twice. 


(check-expect (count-rooms (lookup-room &#34;F&#34; ROOMS) ROOMS) 1)
(check-expect (count-rooms (lookup-room &#34;B&#34; ROOMS) ROOMS) 6)
(check-expect (count-rooms (lookup-room &#34;A&#34; ROOMS) ROOMS) 6)

;; structural recursion only (not tail recursion)
(@template-origin genrec arb-tree accumulator)

(define (count-rooms r0 m)
  ;; path is (listof String); context preserving accumulator, names of rooms
  (local [(define (fn-for-room r path) 
            (if (member (room-name r) path)
                empty
                (cons (room-name r)
                      (fn-for-lor (room-exits r) 
                            (cons (room-name r) path)))))
          (define (fn-for-lor lor path)
            (cond [(empty? lor) empty]
                  [else
                   (append (fn-for-room (lookup-room (first lor) m) path)
                          (fn-for-lor (rest lor) path))]))]
    (foldr &#43; 0 (map (lambda (r) 1) (fn-for-room r0 empty)))))
Additionally, this is the code that I wrote for the function. 2/3 of my tests pass, and the one that fails has the same issue as the code in the solution file. I was wondering if it would be acceptable to write the function this way, as it made more sense to me to do it like this rather than use the abstract functions in the trampoline. If this would not be correct, is this because the accumualtor type is (listof String) and therefore the encapsulated functions should be producing (listof String), and letting the trampoline turn that into a natural? 


(define (count-rooms r0 m)
  ;; path is (listof String); context preserving accumulator, names of rooms
  (local [(define (fn-for-room r path) 
            (if (member (room-name r) path)

Figure Link  (https://cs110.students.cs.ubc.ca/exams/2022w1-f/f-p3-figure.pdf)

The questions are  
Path-wl at E1
path-wl at E2
path-wl at G
(E1 is the first time you see E, E2 second time E is seen)


The question states: each path-wl-at answer must be a list of lists of node names &#34;A&#34;, &#34;B&#34; etc.
Ex: (list (list &#34;A&#34; &#34;B&#34;) (list &#34;A&#34; &#34;B&#34; &#34;C&#34;))


The answers to these questions are below

   0%  of   5.6%  x      path-wl-at-E1 should be ((&#34;A&#34;) (&#34;A&#34;)): incorrect. 
    0%  of   5.6%  x      path-wl-at-E2 should be ((&#34;A&#34; &#34;C&#34;) (&#34;A&#34; &#34;C&#34;) (&#34;A&#34;)): incorrect. 
    0%  of   5.6%  x      path-wl-at-G should be ((&#34;A&#34; &#34;C&#34; &#34;F&#34;) (&#34;A&#34; &#34;C&#34; &#34;F&#34;) (&#34;A&#34; &#34;C&#34;) (&#34;A&#34;)): incorrect. "	1444

2023-12-01T20:01:43Z	Tail recursion and ordinary recursion I understand that tail-recursion with visited accumulators detects joins and cycles while ordinary recursion with path acc detects only cycles.  When deciding which type of recursion to use, we have to consider what the function is going to do.

I am writing to bring to your attention some concerns and suggestions regarding the recent issues with exam submissions and grading. It has come to my attention that some students encountered problems with submission, resulting in a score of 0 for certain questions.

To address this issue and enhance the overall exam experience, I would like to suggest some solutions:

1: Establish a Submission Tracking Platform: I propose the creation of a website or platform that allows students to review the submission count, status, and timestamp of their last submission (without autograde) for each question. In the high-pressure environment of exams, students should be able to focus their attention entirely on answering questions, without the added worry of whether their submissions were successfully recorded or if they indeed submitted their answers. This platform would alleviate unnecessary stress and ensure transparency in the submission process.

2: Consider Remediation for Missed Submissions: For students facing submission issues, is there a possibility of remediation? Could points be recovered through similar questions in subsequent exams? Students encountering these issues do not necessarily lack understanding of the material, and exams may not always provide a fair representation of each student&#39;s true level of proficiency.

In addition, I would like to discuss about exam grading

Reevaluate Grading for Code Errors:
In this course, when students encounter code errors during exams, it often results in a score of 0 or a low score. This approach may inadvertently discourage students from attempting questions outside their comfort zone, as the likelihood of encountering errors is higher. The effort invested does not seem to correlate proportionally with the rewards obtained. This approach appears to contradict the educational philosophy of encouraging students to explore, learn from mistakes, and grow. Could there be a reconsideration of this grading approach to better encourage learning and growth through trial and error?

Thank you for taking the time to consider these suggestions. I am eager to hear your thoughts on the proposed ideas and potential solutions. Your feedback is highly valuable.

In the problem bank, the solution to the starter file &#39;dropn-starter.rkt&#39;  is different to what I have got, however, I don&#39;t know if my solution abides by the principle of preserving the type of the accumulator:



The solution for this file is as follows:

(define (dropn lox0 n)
  ;; acc: Natural; the number of elements to keep before dropping the next one
  ;; (dropn (list &#34;a&#34; &#34;b&#34; &#34;c&#34; &#34;d&#34;) 2)  ;outer call
  ;; 
  ;; (dropn (list &#34;a&#34; &#34;b&#34; &#34;c&#34; &#34;d&#34;) 2)  ; keep 
  ;; (dropn (list     &#34;b&#34; &#34;c&#34; &#34;d&#34;) 1)  ; keep
  ;; (dropn (list         &#34;c&#34; &#34;d&#34;) 0)  ; drop
  ;; (dropn (list             &#34;d&#34;) 2)  ; keep
  ;; (dropn (list                ) 1)  ; keep
  (local [(define (dropn lox acc)
            (cond [(empty? lox) empty]
                  [else
                   (if (zero? acc)
                       (dropn (rest lox) n)
                       (cons (first lox)
                             (dropn (rest lox)
                                    (sub1 acc))))]))]
    (dropn lox0 n)))
However, my solution approaches this problem in a different manner, by incrementing the accumulator until it reaches n:

(define (dropn lox n)
  (local [(define (fn-for-n lox acc)
            (cond [(empty? lox) empty]
                  [else
                   (if (= n acc)
                       (fn-for-n (rest lox) 0)
                       (cons (first lox)
                             (fn-for-n (rest lox) (add1 acc))))]))]
    (fn-for-n lox 0)))

Would this solution still be considered fine?"	1411

2023-11-29T02:43:01Z	"Lecture 20 - Need some guidance Hello, I have been working on m11-maze-4-way-path-starter for a while now, and auto-grader kept returning me the same errors, I believe that I am stuck and I would like some help with my logic.

For problem 2, the autograder gave me the following:
````
     0%  of   3.6%  x      result type: incorrect. 
...
     0%  of   1.8%  x      find-path/p - cond questions intact: incorrect. 
````
For the result type, ~~since the function purpose stated that it `produces
the list of positions from 0,0 to lower right if a maze is solvable;
or fails if the maze is not solvable.` \
 The result type should be \
`(listof Position) or false` \
However, the autograder gave me an incorrect for some reason, and for that I am confused.~~
##### Edit: turned out I made a mistake, the Data definition for position is `Pos` and not `Position`.
\
For the find-path/p, ~~It is essentially the same code for problem one, other than the name change and the trivial answer. I have changed the failing condition from one of the conds expressions back to an if expression in the else cond, and back again. Yet both approaches did not satisfy the autograder.~~
##### Edit: Gregor said we should ignore it and compare our answer with the solution file
\
I would like someone to share some key insights into this, as I am very confused right now.

Thank you!"	1409

Those slots get filled with 81 fillers, which are the integers 1-9, repeated 9 times each.

There are some specific rules about how the fillers can be used.

In other words, Sudoku and the TA solver are quite similar problems.

Also note that the arguments given to the top-level function don&#39;t have to be the same data that represent each node in the tree.  In the maze solver for example the tree is made of positions, even though the top-level argument is a maze.  The tree is a tree of the changing information for the problem.

So from this point the pre-lecture work will always be to carefully review and work through the previous lecture&#39;s material. This will mean you have less material to work on pre-lecture; but the material is more challenging, so be sure to allocate plenty of time for it.

In edX tail recursion question 4 it says that the **`baz`** function call expression is **in tail position** in:
```
(define (foo a)
    (if (bar? a)
        (baz a)
        (bumble a))
```
Meanwhile, in question 8 it says that the **`all-positive?`** function call expression is **not in tail position** in:
```
(define (all-positive? lon)
    (cond [(empty? lon) true]
              [else
                  (and (positive? (first lon))
                           (all-positive? (rest lon)))]
```
### Question
As far as I had understood before module 10, `and` has short-circuiting, so `(and  )` should be equivalent to `(if   false)`. However, according to the edX answers presented above, in the `and` version `` is **not in tail position**, but in the `if` version `` is **in tail position**.

This raised some questions in my mind:
- Since `(and true )` always produces the output of ``, shouldn't `` actually be considered to be in tail position?
- If the answer to the first question is ""No"", does this mean that `(and  )` and `(if   false)` are not equivalent when tail calls are taken into account?
- If the answer to the first question is ""No"", does it justify the decision of using `(if   false)` instead of `(and  )` for tail recursive calls?"	1356

It took me a while to understand how I could have done it with 2 integers representing the upper and lower bounds of the valid range instead and use infinities for the first node).What I&#39;m not sure about is how to properly go about addressing helper functions or such in these types of comments (such as also for 3-step termination arguments, if say the helper is the reducing step of the recursion). Do I just include their signature and a short summary of what they are doing? I guess it&#39;s kind of like writing a type comment for a type of function but that&#39;s kind of weird to think about.I understand that invariant is supposed to be a constant known fact that is consistent throughout the whole recursion but I&#39;m struggling to be able to apply that to an actual thing and be able to point it out (?????)"	1336

    ;(foldr cons empty (map (λ (n) (map circ (build-list n *5))) lon))
    ;(foldr cons empty (map (λ (n) (map circ (map *5 (build-list n id)))) lon))

    ;; foldr instead of single map received 50%
    ;(foldr (lambda (n y) (cons (build-list n circ*5) y)) empty lon)

    ;; just a map as the outer fn, and just a build-list as inner received 50%

These changes caused the stats to move some, specifically:

Problem 1: median changed from 80 to 100, mean changed from 83 to 87.
Problem 2: median stayed at 96, mean changed from 65 to 66

Overall exam mean changed from 72 to 73.

2023-11-20T07:13:28Z	"Abstract Search Function? Hi all,

I had a question about search functions. I came up with this question while working on PSET 9, so I am only asking it now after the submission time has ended.

Does there exist an abstract search function that does the following? If so, what primitive is it (though I assume that we are not allowed to use it), if not, would this be a useful function to create?

The signature of the function would be the following:

(@signature (listof X) (listof Y) (listof (listof X Y)) [listof (X Y (listof X) (listof Y) (listof (listof X Y))) -&gt; Boolean] -&gt; (listof (listof X Y)) or false)
(I used square brackets around the list of functions to make it easier to understand)

This function would try to match every Y with an X. The given (listof (listof X Y)) would be the current matches. The big list of functions would contain a bunch of functions, that each take in the current state of pairings, an X and a Y, and produce true if the given X can be matched with the given Y. Each of these functions would be &#34;anded&#34; together, and if the result is true, the given X can be matched with the given Y. This is iterated through the listof Y until every Y has an X. If a competed solution could be found, the solution would be produced, and false would be produced otherwise.

This function would be very useful. (I think,) this function could be used to solve almost every search function that does not need to produce the entire &#34;correct&#34; tree, and just the result. Some questions I think this could answer are the sudoku problem from edx, PSET 9, the triangle solitaire game, the maze question we did in class, and even an extended maze question where you can go to the left or upwards. It could also be used for solving many more questions. Does it work?

This is just a random thought that I had. Does this make sense at all?

Thanks for reading!"	1321

I think this would be beneficial because then I can strategize and allot my time to questions that are worth more and less time to those that are worth less. I feel like this is a fair request because math tests always say how many marks the test is out of and how many marks each question is worth. I also realize the weighting of the questions might be done after the midterm is over and marked, but I am still curious.	1316

Feedback on Individual Problems 
Problem 1 
This problem assessed your understanding of key terminology we use in the course. Again, terminology is important because you need it to understand what we are saying in the more complex lectures, labs, problem sets and the final. 
 
If you did not do well on this question, please review the glossary. 
 
Problem 2 
This problem assessed your ability to use built-in abstract functions to complete a function definition.  
The most common mistakes were not using build-list properly, or needlessly using map around each build-list. The grader was set to be very lenient about redundant maps. 
 
If you did not do well on this question, please review module 8 on using built-in abstract functions. There are also numerous problem bank problems you can use to practice this material. 
 
Problem 3 
This problem assessed your understanding of the rules of local evaluation, and your ability to use that knowledge to identify what functions are lifted over the course of an evaluation.  
 
A number of people were apparently unprepared for local evaluation problems, which is surprising since there were several practice problems out there. This material is very important because we will continue to use local and closures throughout the course. Being able to simulate the evaluation of a program is important in all programming languages and approaches to software development. While debugging tools can be very helpful for larger programs, it is still necessary to be able to determine exactly what each part of the code produces when evaluated. 
 
The most common mistakes were: 
Renaming parameters when lifting (they should not be renamed). Not lifting the second function originally named bar. Not properly naming the lift of the second function originally named bar. Not actually lifting the definitions. 
 
If you did not do well on this question, please review the rules of local evaluation on the language page. We also suggest you can use the stepper to understand exactly where your hand stepping diverged from the evaluation rules. We may have to assess this material once again on the final exam.  
 
Problem 4 
This problem assessed your ability to identify mutual reference and self-reference relationships in types. We knew that this problem was not at all difficult. We included it primarily to cause you to pause and think about the reference relationships in the types before proceeding to the more difficult problems 5, 6, and 7. 
 
Problem 5 
This problem assessed your understanding of designing a relatively simple mutually recursive function. If you did not do well on this question, please review module 6 carefully. This material is key to nearly every lecture the rest of this term. 
 
Problem 6 
This problem assessed your ability to complete the design of abstract fold functions by using type inference to develop the signature, and also writing the copy and count tests. If you did not do well on this question, please review the lecture material from module 8 on this topic. 
 
Problem 7 
This problem also assessed your ability to design functions involving mutual recursion. But in contrast to problem 5, this problem required that you have a very clear understanding of when and how to use try-catch. 
 
The most common mistake was not using try-catch in all the places where it was required. 
 
If you did not do well on this question, please carefully review the solution and ask questions in office hours. 
 
 
What Getting a Low Grade Means 
It is important to keep in mind that the course is about to pick up in both speed and complexity. Please take the feedback you are receiving from this exam as useful information going into the rest of the course.  
 
70 - 80 Spend time reviewing the exam and working through problems to correct the misconceptions you demonstrated.  
 
60 - 70 We encourage you to attend TA or instructor office hours as soon as you can this coming week. At these office hours ask the course staff to review your exam and your work to date. They will be able to help you develop a plan for getting caught up. Plan to work 2 hours extra each day this week to get caught up.  
 
For grades below 60, a great deal of work will be required during the next week to succeed in the remainder of the course. Please do not wait to get help, instead reach out in office hours right away so we can help you plan. (Gregor will try to add special office hours Monday, TBD.)

As I understand it, and argument is a function expression after it has been evaluated. But I fail to see how this is helpful under any circumstances.

Consider:
(fn1 (fn2 a b))
step and we get:
(fn1 c)

so... is c an argument then? Or is it an operand? Or both? If both, which one is more fitting?

Step again and we get:
d

is d an argument? Assuming that d can no longer be further evaluated, d is also a constant, no?

It seems like from a &#34;static&#34; viewpoint, nothing is an argument. I want to confirm this, and finally be clear with what an argument is in BSL/ISL.

It is just a helpful tool to test functions while composing a function as you can&#39;t do that on the file with the problems when there is a syntax error or other type of errors. 

edit: scrap file no longer needed; I don&#39;t know what I did differently but any function I put in the interaction window still works even when there is a syntax error, I was sure it didn&#39;t work before.

Thank you for the ctrl d hack though."	1257

2023-11-15T23:04:20Z	"Is it reasonable to use a fold function here? In 2020w2-mt2 P3, a question asks us to design a function that finds an item with a certain key inside a tree.The solution is as follows:

(define (find-val tt key)
  (cond [(false? tt) false]
        [else
         (if (= (node-k tt) key)
             (node-v tt)
             (local [(define try (find-val (node-lef tt) key))]
               (if (not (false? try))

                         try
                         (find-val (node-rig tt) key))))))]))

I am wondering if it is reasonable to use the provided fold-ttree function which is:

(define (fold-ttree c b tt)
  (cond [(false? tt) b]
        [else
         (c (node-k tt)
            (node-v tt)
            (fold-ttree c b (node-lef tt))
            (fold-ttree c b (node-mid tt))
            (fold-ttree c b (node-rig tt)))]))

It seems to be possible to use this function but is it reasonable? The question states:

;; NOTE: If it is appropriate to use the fold-ttree function then you will
;;       lose 20% marks from an otherwise correct solution if you do not
;;       use it.
;;
;;       If it is not appropriate to use the fold-tree function, but you
;;       do use it then you will lose 30% off an otherwise correct solution.

It would be a long function that would have to be given to fold-ttree but I don&#39;t think it is unreasonable to do so, yet the solution does not use fold-ttree. Why is this?"	1250

```
(@signature (listof Number) Number -> Number)
...
;; CONSTRAINT: lon contains no duplicates, and has at least n+1 elements
```

By @377 this means that the input could be, for example, `(qselect (-3 4.5 92) 1.4)` - these are valid `Number` values, and there are more than 1.4+1=2.4 elements in the list, as there are 3 elements. This would mean that `qselect` should properly handle these inputs, and this should be verified using `check-expects`.

However, the provided solution breaks on the following input:
```
(qselect (list 4 3 2 1) 2.5)
```
with the error `rest: expects a non-empty list; given: empty`. I would expect the result to be `4`, although I could be wrong about this - but in any case, the signature indicates that the function should be able to handle this somehow.

There are clearly more than 2.5+1=3.5 elements in this list, there are 4 elements, so I would assume this input is valid. My question is: am I correctly interpreting what input the `qselect` function must be able to take? Does my above input follow those guidelines? And if so, why does it break the solution?"	1213

However, autograder marks this incorrect because the solution uses cond instead of if and that there&#39;s 2 calls to filter. The question does not specify that we must use at most 2 filter calls.

How would one decide whether to use if or cond in similar questions?

My Solution:


;(define (qselect lon n) 0) ;stub

(@template-origin genrec)

(define (qselect lon n)
  (cond [(empty? (rest lon)) (first lon)]
        [else
         (local [(define p (first lon))
                 (define (&lt;p? n) (&lt; n p))
                 (define (&gt;p? n) (&gt; n p))]
           (if (= n (length (filter &lt;p? lon)))
               p
               (if (&lt; n (length (filter &lt;p? lon)))
                   (qselect (filter &lt;p? lon) n)
                   (qselect (filter &gt;p? lon) (sub1 n)))))]))

Answer Key:

(define (qselect lon n)
  (cond [(empty? (rest lon)) (first lon)]
        [else
         (local [(define p (first lon))
                 (define lon&lt;p (filter (lambda (n) (&lt; n p)) lon))]
           (cond [(= n (length lon&lt;p)) p]
                 [(&lt; n (length lon&lt;p)) (qselect lon&lt;p n)]
                 [else
                  (qselect (filter (lambda (n) (&gt; n p)) lon)
                           (- n (length lon&lt;p) 1))]))]))"	1206

The function definition MUST NOT use any part of the recursive Natural template
or the (listof X) template.
- it must not include (cond [(empty? … anywhere      
- it must not include (cond [(zero? … anywhere      
- it must not include (if (empty? … anywhere      
- it must not include (if (zero? … anywhere

However, it appears that the solution (below) uses conditional expressions in non-recursive parts of the code (such as whether a certain colour is used for the number’s font or if an empty image is used. Is it fair to assume the above note means we are still allowed to use if-expressions as long as they are not used as conditions of whether or not the function will recurse?

When I was trying to solve p6, I noticed that the question is similar to a generic recursion. So I tried to the template for genrec to solve it.

However, with the current code, I am unable to form the shape as instructed.

                            empty-image
                            (rectangle SIZE (* SIZE 1) PEN COLOR)))

;genrec
(define (pyramid n)
  (cond [(&lt;= n 0) empty-image]
        [else

                         sub))]))
and what I have is:

I understand my problem is that at each recursion, the height increases instead of decreasing, because I use n to specify the height.

However, I can&#39;t think of a way to generate an n in the right way. I am thinking using a constant parameter to &#34;fix&#34; the initial n, and then use it to subtract the new n, but it does not seem to work.

2023-11-14T05:32:49Z	"2022w2-mt2 p4: abstract function choice I'm a bit confused about the abstract function choice in the solution of this question.

The provided solution is:
```
(define (most-occurrences l1 l2)
  (foldr max
         0
         (map (lambda (i1)
                (length (filter (lambda (i2) (= i2 i1)) l2)))
              l1))
```
This uses `foldr`, `map`, and `filter`.

My solution was:
```racket
(define (most-occurrences l1 l2)
  (local [(define (to-occurences y)
            (length (filter (lambda (x) (= x y)) l2)))]
    (apply max (map to-occurences (cons 0 l1)))))
```
This was marked as an incorrect abstract function choice.

As you can see, the answers are fairly similar - aside from my choice to use `local`, the only difference is that the solution uses `foldr` and mine uses `apply` with an extra 0 `cons`ed onto the list to handle the case where it's empty. Is this not a valid solution? `apply` is arguably more expressive here, it makes it immediately clear that we're looking for the largest item in the list."	1181

I am not sure how to find signature for abstract function. 
Based on what I knew,  we need to see what each parameter consume and produce. I am not sure if my thought is correct or not. For example, at position C1, it takes a value p and produce a list of string. And C2 also did similar thing like take a data y and produce list of y. I am not sure how to approach other parameter. Maybe I got C1 and C2 wrong as well. Could anyone gives a tip when encountering this problem and what need to do?

(define FOO 10)

(define (doit a lon)
  (local [(define (fn x) (if (odd? x) (add1 x) (sub1 x)))
          (define b (foldr &#43; 0 lon))
          (define (bar x)
            (local [(define (foo y)
                      (if (zero? x)

              (foo a)))]
    (map bar lon)))

(doit 3 (list 1 2 3))

I answered 4 because I saw only four local definitions: fn, b, bar, and foo. But the correct answer is 6. Is this because foo is lifted three times? Why is foo lifted 3 times?

Following up on that question, how many times will bar be lifted? In my understanding, it will be lifted three times for every element in the list (list 1 2 3). But if that’s the case, won’t the answer to Part 4 be 8 and not 6?

I often find myself writing abstract functions and their functions compositions that solve the problem I am trying to do. However, sometimes I lose marks on using the most optimal combination. Is there a good way to tell whether the combination I&#39;m using is optimal?

What I thought is its based on reducing recomputation, as in we want each abstract function in the composition to do only one task, and avoid needless or long computation. Although I struggle to do problems this way sometimes because I can&#39;t tell if what I&#39;m writing would increase computation.

2023-11-12T23:33:33Z	"2022w1-mt2 Problem 5 - Question about Grading Rubric Hi there,

For Problem #5 on 2022w1-mt2, I got all my tests to pass and no errors upon running the file; however, upon checking my mark for that problem, I was surprised to find out I only got 55%. The reason being: &#34;choice of abstract functions: incorrect&#34;. I used 2 &#34;ormap&#34; built-in abstract functions wrapped in an &#34;or&#34; predicate to check that x exists in the first list and not the second. The second ormap is wrapped in a &#34;not&#34;. 

Now, I understand that a lot of other files have the following line in the instructions:

&#34;The result of the function must directly be the result of one of the built-in abstract functions. So, for example, the following would not    be a valid function body:
       (define (foo x)         (empty? (filter ...)))&#34;

But this file didn&#39;t have that, so I don&#39;t see why my solution can&#39;t be accepted."	1139

I had missed my Lab04 due to me not being aware that it was rescheduled to another day for that week. When I was aware, I spoke to one of the TAs in my section asking if there was anything I could do, however, they said there was nothing. Today I came across the fact that we could have completed a concession form, which would have worked at the time as it was within 7 days (if I am not mistaken). 

Does one missed lab have a effect on my lab grade? If yes, is there anything I could do to combat this and how much does it affect it?

2. Each time we split the list into two sub-lists. one with all element less than e, one with all element greater than e. we call these two lists p and q
3. If n is less than the length of p, the answer is the n-th smallest element of p;
    If n is equal to p, the answer is e;
    Otherwise, the answer is the n - (length of list p) - 1 -th smallest element of q.
Apparently the function would terminate, since each time we picked a sub-list.

However, if I write my function like this:

(define (qselect lon n)  (local [(define e (first lon))          (define lchild (filter (λ (n) (&lt; n e)) lon))          (define rchild (filter (λ (n) (&gt; n e)) lon))          (define (foo a r) (&#43; r 1))          (define sz (foldr foo 0 lchild))]    (if (&lt; n sz)        (qselect lchild n)        (if (= n sz)            e            (qselect rchild (- (- n sz) 1))))))

I lost 10 marks because I didn&#39;t use the generative recursion template:

if (trival? ...)
    (...)
    (...)

In the given solution, there is this line:  (cond [(empty? (rest lon)) (first lon)]

However, I think that removing this line does not affect the correctness of our algorithm at all.

Must we rigidly follow the template given?"	1104

2023-11-10T22:20:10Z	"2022 w2 mt2 p4 Super confused about this code Hi! I am very confused about the code for this question. This is the question:

quickselect produces the nth smallest element in the given list (USING 0 BASED INDEXING),
 where n is a parameter to the function. In this version of quickselect we are 
 allowing you to place 2 additional constraints on the arguments:

   - the list contains no duplicates
   - the list contains at least n&#43;1 elements

 Note that this is a generative recursion problem. You should use the genrec
 template, and your function should work as follows:

   - take the first element of the list (lon) as a pivot (p), and split the
     list into two new lists, one with elements less than p (lon&lt;p) and one
     with elements &gt; than p (lon&gt;p)
   - if the lon&lt;p sublist contains the nth element of lon, produce the result
     of recursing on that sublist and n
   - if p is the nth element of lon produce p
   - otherwise produce the result of recursing on the second sublist and an
     appropriately reduced n

I am confused about the code in the else. Why are we reducing the n to (- n (length (lon&lt;p) 1)) ? I went through a check expect example step by step and it definitely works, but how could we have thought of using this? Where did this come from exactly? 


(define (qselect lon n)
	(cond [(empty? (rest lon)) (first lon)]

2023-11-10T06:11:40Z	"2023s-mt2 problem2 
I have a problem with the &#34;B&#34; why it is considered  as an operand instead of argument.
I have looked the definiton of these two glossary, and it said that:
Argument
An argument is a value that passed to a function or a primitive operation when it is called. The arguments are the values that result from evaluating the operands in the function or primitive call. See parameter for a discussion of the differences between operands, arguments and parameters
Operand
The expressions following the function name in a function call expression (or the operator name in a primitive call expression) are called operands.
Parameter
A parameter is an identifier (or name) used in a function declaration that represents the changing value, or the variable. The parameter(s) appear in parentheses just after the function name. Within the body of the function the parameters stand for the arguments each time the function is called.

Though I can understand that it can be considered as an operand because it is an expression(value is also an expression) following the function name ouster, it also fulfil the definition of argument, since it is a value passed to a function ouster and the function has been defined. 


What&#39; more, I am wondering which part should be --if expression in these codes. The solution told us E is an &#34;expression&#34; instead of &#34;if expression&#34;

I&#39;d like to confirm my definition of a closure statement: A closure statement relates to a function that is called within an abstract function and is defined within a local expression - in this case the function bar is called by the map abstract function and is defined within the enclosed local statement.

FIRST is that the midterm will have 7 problems.  It isn&#39;t so much longer than prior midterms, as it is that we are splitting things out into separate problems in separate files so that any red errors don&#39;t affect as much of the grading.  It is still the case that a red error will cause a given file to get 0 marks, but with each file containing less of the exam the effect of a red error will be reduced.

SECOND is that we previously announced that midterm 2 problem 3 would replace your midterm 1 problem 4 score.  We are keeping this policy, except that it will be midterm 2 problem 5 that will replace your midterm 1 problem 4 score.  This change allows us to order the problems on midterm 2 better.  It does not represent any change in our policy about replacing midterm 1 problem 4 score.  For greater clarity, the revised policy is:


After midterm 2, your midterm 1 problem 4 score will become the higher of the original score and your midterm 2 problem 5 score. So if for any reason you did poorly on midterm 1 problem 4 you have a chance to make that up by doing well on problem 5 of midterm 2.

From what im understanding, it seems like unlike previous functions we designed where we made the data, now the function is making its own data (as in the name, &#34;generative&#34;)However, I am bit confused on what exactly a generative recursion is... It would be cool if someone could clear it up a bit. Would a good approach to understanding it more be through doing all the problem bank questions relating to generative recursion like what we have done with the other modules? Or would it also be a good idea to look back at the edx and lecture and carefully analyze what is going on in each part of a function working with generative recursion first?	1032

I&#39;m reviewing the solutions to pset6 and the solution used cons in their function definitions for a couple questions while the check-expects used list. I used list for both the check-expects and the function definition because I wanted to test longer cases. I understand that it&#39;s fine to use either cons or list when you want to produce a list of something because list basically abbreviates cons, but I don&#39;t get how they could be used interchangeably in the same question. If we used cons in the definition, wouldn&#39;t the result of a check-expect look like:
(check-expect (all-course-numbers--course C213) (cons 213 (cons 313 (cons 317 empty))))))

2023-11-01T02:34:49Z	"Lab 6 Challenge Question I attempted the lab 6 challenge question, which asks to design a function that produces a list of the sentences in a given sentence tree.

I was able to get it to produce a list of sentences, but for sentences with more than one sub tree, I wasn&#39;t sure how to make the function go back into the tree and produce a prefix again but with another sub tree. 

For context, here is the function I have: 
(define (all-sentences--stree stree)  (cond [(empty? (stree-subs stree))         (cons (stree-prefix stree) (all-sentences--lost (stree-subs stree)))]        [else         (cons          (string-append (stree-prefix stree)                         &#34; &#34;                         (stree-prefix (first (stree-subs stree))))                    (all-sentences--lost (rest (stree-subs stree))))]))

The all-sentences--lost function just appends the first sentence tree with the rest.

The main learning objective of the problem was always the same.  abstract fold functions go through the whole data every time, no matter what your combination functions are doing.  So you can&#39;t use a fold function for a search that wants to stop when it finds what it is looking for.

2023-10-31T19:31:45Z	"disappointed about iClicker Hi I just wanna express some thoughts about the iClicker

Firstly, the time given to answer the question is too short. Every time I see the question on the screen I need to pick up my phone and unlock it, unlike zoom, I just click on the same device. I hadn’t finished reading the question yet, TA had started to countdown. And for some newly appeared code, I need time to think about how it works, but I don’t think I have that much time. I spent hours watching every edx video before every lecture, but I still can’t make it right because of those reasons.

Secondly, I’m not sure if the previous Zoom questions still count for the grade or just totally abandoned. Before we switched to the iClicker, the question was much easier, if it was abandoned, every time the cost of making a mistake is higher a lot, which is kinda unfair compared with previous sections.

Thirdly, the technical issues. Although I never met them but I heard about someone asking for that every lecture.

I don’t know if anyone feels the same way as me, but the iClicker part really disappoints me. Not mean to cause any trouble, just some thoughts as a student in this course. "	984

In the explanation of map:
The starter says:

 - map always produces a list of the same length as it&#39;s argument.   In general the elememts of the result list are not the same as   the argument list.

(&#34;it&#39;s&#34; instead of &#34;its&#34; (though &#34;its&#34; is correctly employed in the other explanations) and &#34;elememts&#34; instead of &#34;elements&#34;)

What it should say:

 - map always produces a list of the same length as its argument.   In general the elements of the result list are not the same as   the argument list.



In problem 1:
The starter says:

;;;; First stage of templating produces this:;;#;(define (circles lon)  (map one-circle lon))

;;;; But then we realize that the helper to go in ... probably does not;; already exist in the help desk.  So we will have to design a local;; helper.  Update the template to:;;


Which, judging by the comments, should say:

;;;; First stage of templating produces this:;;#;(define (circles lon)  (map ... lon))

;;;; But then we realize that the helper to go in ... probably does not;; already exist in the help desk.  So we will have to design a local;; helper.  Update the template to:;;



The solution file also has a slight typo:
For Problem 2&#39;s function definition it says:

(define (keep-in-interval lo hi lon)  (local [(@signature Integer -&gt; boolean)          ;; produce true if n is in the interval          (@template-origin Integer)          (define (in-interval? n)

(With a lowercase instead of uppercase B for Boolean)

It should say:

(define (keep-in-interval lo hi lon)  (local [(@signature Integer -&gt; Boolean)          ;; produce true if n is in the interval          (@template-origin Integer)          (define (in-interval? n)

        [(empty? l2) l1]               ;[2]

This is my solution

(define (merge lon1 lon2)
  (cond [(or (empty? lon1) (empty? lon2))
         (append lon1 lon2)]
        [else
         (if (&lt;= (first lon1) (first lon2))
             (cons (first lon1) (merge (rest lon1) lon2))
             (cons (first lon2) (merge lon1 (rest lon2))))]))
As you can see, the solution use 3 conds but I used only 2 conds.

Because either lon1 is empty or lon2 is empty, the result would be (append lon1 lon2). 
However, the solution split them into 2 conds.

Why is that?

The core of 2-one-of is to simplify the function according to the type comment table.
We know that either lon1 is empty or lon2 is empty, the result is always (append lon1 lon2).
Why the solution split them and why my answer is not accepted?
I passed all of test in autograder. Marked reduced only because I used 2 conds, not 3.

Is there someone who can explain to me in detail?

Edit:

This is the same as in the BinaryTree and Path question

This is my solution

(define (has-path? bt p)
  (cond [(false? bt) false]
        [(empty? p) true]
        [else
         (if (string=? (first p) &#34;L&#34;)
             (if (false? (node-l bt))
                 false
                 (has-path? (node-l bt) (rest p)))
             (if (false? (node-r bt))
                 false
                 (has-path? (node-r bt) (rest p))))]))
This is problem solution

(define (has-path? bt p)   
  (cond [(false? bt) false]                                           ;[1]
        [(empty? p)  true]                                            ;[2]
        [(string=? (first p) &#34;L&#34;) (has-path? (node-l bt) (rest p))]   ;[3]
        [else                     (has-path? (node-r bt) (rest p))])) ;[4]

In lab 6, why did the autograder order the SentenceTree (stree) data structure before the ListOfSentenceTree (lost) one? Even though the code works either way, the autograder insists that stree goes before every instance of its corresponding lost.

I expect that if a similar problem as the one from lab 6 is put on the next exam or final, the autograder will also grade the problem wrong (all the signatures, template-origins, etc) if the order of two data structures from a mutal reference is incorrect. Can someone clarify whether this is specific to lab autograding or should we understand the logic of this ordering for the exams?

In general, how do we confidently determine which data structure goes first in a mutual reference (including in instances where code encapsulation is used in a function)?"	969

2023-10-27T17:20:18Z	"Struggling With Boxes Function from m08-use-bia-fn-starter This was how I approached the problem:
1. Game plan: First use build-list to convert n into a list consisting of n squares. Then use foldr to create a recursive call to the list with the overlay function

2. (build-list function): from a natural n, create a list of squares

Goal of this step:
(build-list 3 &lt;function&gt;) --&gt; (list O O O) where O represents a circle
(build-list 2 &lt;function&gt;) --&gt; (list O O)
(build-list 0 &lt;function&gt;) --&gt; empty

(@signature Natural (Natural -&gt; X) -&gt; (listof X))
(build-list n sq-image)

;; Then define the function sq-image
(define (sq-image n) (square (&#43; (* n 10) 1) &#34;outline&#34; &#34;black&#34;))
3. Use foldr to overlay the list of squares: First define an example and then write out the foldr template

Goal of this step
(list (square 1) (square 11) (square 21)) --&gt; (overlay (square 21) (square 11) (square 1) empty-image)

;; Write out the foldr template
(foldr fn y listof) --&gt; (fn x0 (fn x1 (fn x2 ... (fn xn-1 y))))
(@signature (X Y -&gt; Y) Y (listof X) -&gt; Y)
Then define fn and y within the foldr template

(define (fn x y)
   (overlay x y))

y = empty-image
Then put all the functions together:

(@template-origin fn-composition use-abstract-fn)
(define (boxes n)
  (local [(define (sq-image n) (square (&#43; (* n 10) 1) &#34;outline&#34; &#34;black&#34;)))
           (define (fn x y)  (overlay x y))]
     (foldr fn empty-image (build-list n sq-image))))
But won&#39;t this result produce the following if we call boxes 3:

(overlay (square 1) (overlay (square 11) (overlay (square 21) empty-image))))
The result we want is:

(overlay (square 21) (square 11) (square 1) empty-image)
Why is the function definition above correct?
Also, could someone please confirm my thought process?"	952

(define-struct account (num name));; Accounts is one of:;;  - empty;;  - (cons (make-account Natural String) Accounts);; interp. a list of accounts, where each ;;           num  is an account number ;;           name is the person&#39;s first name(define ACS1 empty)(define ACS2  (list (make-account 1 &#34;abc&#34;) (make-account 4 &#34;dcj&#34;) (make-account 3 &#34;ilk&#34;)   (make-account 7 &#34;ruf&#34;)))#;(define (fn-for-accounts accs)  (cond [(empty? accs) (...)]        [else         (...

It appears that the code created doesn&#39;t include a natural helper in reference to the data type Account. I&#39;m assuming in the current course we should create the helper function template and the reference to our natural helper in our Accounts data template separately rather than combining both into one template? Also, it seems that for the @htdd tag of BST during the lecture, we are not including the data type Node, is that just a specific rule for BST&#39;s, since normally it would seem that we should include all of the created data types in a @htdd tag?

Thanks in advance!"	900

2023-10-20T21:38:48Z	"Writing Tests for Mutual Recursions - What is the Perferred Method? Hello, 

I wanted to know what is the preferred way of writing tests for mutual recursion.
For example:
 
```
(@htdd Foo ListOfFoo)
(define-struct node (a inners))
;; Foo is (make-node Integer ListOfFoo)
;; ListOfFoo is one of
;;  - empty
;;  - Foo ListOfFoo
(define LOF0 empty)
(define FOO0 (make-foo 0 lof0))
(define FOO1 (make-foo 1 lof0))
(@htdf bar?--foo bar?--lof)
(@signature Foo -> Boolean)
(@signature ListOfFoo -> Boolean)
;; bar? returns true when there is at least one odd number
``` 
if I want to write tests for `bar?--foo` and `bar?--lof`, should I write:
```
(check-expect (bar?--foo FOO0) false
;;
```
or
```
(check-expect (bar?--foo FOO0) 
              (or (odd? (node-a FOO0)) ; odd? is a defined function
                  (bar?--lof (node-inners FOO0)))
;;
```
?
Personally, I think the latter one is better because I can test if `bar?--foo` is functioning as expected even when `bar?--lof` is just a stub.  But I may have heard (misheard?) some TAs say that the former one is better. So please elaborate on that!

Questions 2-6: We were provided the data definitions for the data types &#34;BinaryTree&#34; and &#34;Path&#34; and were told to design a function that consumes a &#34;BinaryTree&#34; and a &#34;Path&#34; but weren&#39;t told what it&#39;s supposed to produce or what the purpose of the function is. Should I assume this is the function we discussed in class where we are trying to go down the path? If so, a purpose and stub would be helpful to understand what the check-expects should produce. Maybe I am supposed to infer the purpose from the data definition alone or maybe I missed an EdX tab altogether. Here is Question 2:

For instance, in many lectures and problem sets, we created functions that just &#39;did&#39; the task rather than having another helper function to do the task. Like for this function

(define (boxes n)

Operation On Arbitrary Size Data.
Say you are writing a sorting function. Within this function you must iterate through an arbitrary sized list in order to find out where to THEN insert a specific element to keep the list sorted. This iteration, by the Arbitrary Size rule, should be done in a helper.

Doman Shift:
You are writing a function to render a given set of images with different &#34;colours&#34; applied, before rendering the organized image, the images must be given &#34;colours&#34;.This is problem is outside of the context of the original function (to render) and so by the domain shift rule must be done in a helper.

I understand that a reference calls for a natural helper, but the three new rules confuse me a little.

So, anytime we operate on a list do we use a helper? Or only when we operate on the whole list and not the first element only?

Secondly, function composition and domain knowledge shift, I understand both of their concepts; however, they are a little difficult to tell apart. Because for function composition, we do it when we must preform two or more distinct operations on the data and we use knowledge domain shift when we suddenly do something different on the data in the function. They are both very similar, is there something I am missing to distinguish them?

We used HEIGHT-1 in problem set 3 and 4 (BOT was the constant used for HEIGHT-1) to check whether the Ball(s) made contact with the bottom of the screen or not and I&#39;m struggling to understand why the same concept isn&#39;t being applied here. 
This is what the making-rain-filtered-solution.rkt suggests is the correct answer:

(define HEIGHT 300)

(check-expect (onscreen? (make-drop 2  0)) true)
(check-expect (onscreen? (make-drop 2  1)) true)

(check-expect (onscreen? (make-drop 2    HEIGHT))    true)
(check-expect (onscreen? (make-drop 2 (&#43; HEIGHT 1))) false)
And this is what I am suggesting with the usage of HEIGHT-1:

(define HEIGHT 300)
(define BOT (- HEIGHT 1)) ;evaluates to 299
; =======================
(check-expect (onscreen? (make-drop 2 -1)) false)
(check-expect (onscreen? (make-drop 2  0)) true)
(check-expect (onscreen? (make-drop 2  1)) true)
(check-expect (onscreen? (make-drop 2 (- BOT 1))) true)
(check-expect (onscreen? (make-drop 2    BOT))    true)
(check-expect (onscreen? (make-drop 2 (&#43; BOT 1))) false)
Additionally, I am a bit confused on why the height of the DROP is not considered because the solution is designed in a way such that the Drop is removed when the middle of the Drop (vertical middle) reaches the bottom. Based on this design, the Drop is technically still on the screen since the upper half of the DROP image is still visible (you can exaggerate the visibility of this by increasing the height of the ellipse); this may be due to the ambiguity of the problem but if it isn&#39;t then I would like to know what key word in the problem suggests that we do not have to consider the upper half of the Drop.

Hello, sometimes while I am scrolling through the Racket IDE it will randomly freeze. I opened activity monitor to see my swap increasing at an alarming rate. Moments later Mac asks me to force close Dr Racket. I&#39;m not sure why this is happening this is a relatively new Mac model and has 16 gb of ram so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a hardware issue. It&#39;s been happening for all of today and I&#39;m worried that it might happen on an exam. Any ideas as to why this may be happening?To add to this I am on Racket version 8.6 could this be the issue?"	797

Some thoughts:- Don&#39;t know a way to write tests for perform-raycast function in this case as I do not know how to calculate the terminal &#39;vector&#39;/position for any cases where both dx and dy are non-zero. Probably a violation of design recipes but that&#39;s how I&#39;m leaving it for now, until I can figure out how.

- Don&#39;t know if perform-raycast is using recursion properly. I tried with little success multiple data definitions that tried to incorporate the well-formed self-referential data structure but couldn&#39;t make one that would actually suit the problem. Part of me suspects that this might be because position wasn&#39;t a data structure like a list that had a natural progression (e.g. repeatedly taking the rest of list until final/base case). It also did not really care about any of the intermediate steps, only what the final one was, so the definition of combination and contribution parts are shaky here. I ended up using generative recursion as it seemed to be more straightforward though I am not confident that I implemented that properly either. Perhaps I am still thinking iteratively rather than recursively, or that the problem is not suitable for recursion at all. Perhaps as the course progresses and I understand things more a better method could be implemented.- Ideally, dx and dy should be confined to be within a certain magnitude, forming a unit circle around x and y, as they are direction rather than actual position (at least for &#39;vector&#39;, don&#39;t know about actual vectors). Multiplying by INCREMENT does not actually achieve this, but is a Band-Aid solution to at least ensure that next-vector is not changing vectors by too much every step. Will have to figure out the math for this at some point, but it probably involves trig which I am not strong in."	792

The solution to P5 above uses a helper function that produces a Boolean. However, in my solution of the problem, I used a function that returns a Natural that returns 0 if the flight does not meet the conditions and 1 if it does. As such, I was only adding the result of the helper function to the NR, which made the recursive function effectively the same as the solution in terms of what it does. However, my solution to the problem got a 67% from the autograder.There was also no indication that we should use a helper function that returns a Boolean in the problem statement. So does the helper function, in these cases, ALWAYS have to produce a boolean? "	788

2023-10-05T21:30:52Z	Use of constants in tests In my problem set evaluation, I was deducted marks for not using constants in my check-expects. As the Pset involved a world program with constants like HEIGHT, WIDTH, etc., it made sense to use constants to improve readability and changeability. But I also heard that using data examples in check-expects is also not acceptable since it would require scrolling up to understand the test. In recent lectures, constants specifically meant for testing were defined to make writing tests less cumbersome; however, this is covered in a later module so I&#39;m not sure if it is acceptable in Midterm 1. So I was hoping for some clarification on when we should use constants in tests and when we shouldn&#39;t. 	783
2023-10-05T21:18:53Z	"Tests for parent function of a natural helper According to the design recipes page, we are allowed to assume that all helper functions, including the natural helper work properly in our tests. But in one of the midterms (exams/2022w1-mt1/mt1-p4), I chose not to thoroughly test the boundary (boundary &#43; 1, boundary, boundary - 1) since I already tested the boundary in the helper. But the auto grader said that my tests were not thorough. Including the boundary conditions for both parent and helper function solved the problem. 

So I was wondering whether it is acceptable to only test the boundary conditions for the helper functions and not the parent functions in exams."	781

I am still confused about the helper rule.

The helper function in the solution only produces the volume of the cube. How come it doesn&#39;t produce a boolean, stating if the volume was larger/smaller than n, similar to how 2022w1 mt1 p4 does it (weight of the package question) or the profitable flights problem?

Design a function that consumes a list of numbers lon, and a number n, in thatorder.  The function should compute the product of the numbers in the listas long as the numbers are &lt; n.  So, for example:
(product-while (cons 3 (cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 4 (cons 6 empty)))))                4)
should produce 6, which is 3 * 1 * 2
But note that it only keeps going until the first element of the list thatis not &lt; n.
Your function design must include a @signature, purpose, commented out stub,appropriate tests, a @template-origin tag, a @template tag, and a functiondefinition.
This problem will be autograded.  NOTE that all of the following are required.Violating one or more will cause your solution to receive 0 marks.

(define (fn-for-lop lop)
  (cond [(empty? lop) (...)]
        [else
         (... (fn-for-phone (first lop))
              (fn-for-lop (rest lop)))]))
The &#34;count&#34; function expects to take in a list, as well as a brand (String) and a price (Natural). When modifying this template to take in a String and Natural along with the ListOfPhone, would the following be correct?

(@template
 (define (count lop str n)
   (cond [(empty? lop) (... str n)]
         [else
          (... str n (fn-for-phone (first lop) str n)
               (count (rest lop) str n))])))
Hoping someone can clarify if parameters need to be added after every ellipsis and inside every function in the template. Thanks :)"	758
2023-10-05T06:27:29Z	"2022 MT1 W2 - Q4 
Q. Design a function that consumes a list of numbers lon, and a number n, in that order.  The function should compute the product of the numbers in the list as long as the numbers are &lt; n.  So, for example (product-while (cons 3 (cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 4 (cons 6 empty))))) 4) should produce 6, which is 3 * 1 * 2. Note that it keeps going until the first element of the list that is not &lt; n,
so (product-while (cons 5 (cons 2 empty)) 9) produces 10.


-&gt; So my question is what will the output number be when the list is  (cons 7 (cons 3 (cons 5 (cons 1(cons 6 empty) and the num is 6? Will it be 1 or (* 3 5 1).

Idk if the list just exits when it finds a number &gt;= 6 or skips it and keeps moving.


[EDIT : I FIGURED IT OUT -&gt; It will be 1.]

In general, what should we write in the template origin tag when there are multiple primitive parameters?	755

I compare my solution to the answer key and have the exact same cases as the answer key, for example, what happens when x goes past a specific number. The only difference is the numbers I use are different from the answer key and I get docked marks for test thoroughness.

If you look at template and function definition, argument is different. (fund-one-project p n) for template and (fund-one-project p f) for function body.

They are the same because in the signature, we mentioned Project Natural, however, when I typed differently last time, autograder decreases my mark before.

2023-10-05T00:50:18Z	"(request) Autograder Additional Tests During Cooldown Hi all,

During Problem Set 4, I was able to complete the entirety of the problem set except for one small difference: My interpretation of the handle-mouse function for adding a ball was different from the expected solution. 

The expected solution intended for the new ball being added to be placed at the start of the list, while my solution placed it at the end. This was an additional test case that lost 1% on the final mark, despite the function passing all tests and completing the provided function purpose. 

I could have eventually figured out this expected solution if the autograder had given feedback on additional tests during the cooldown period. Instead, I tested 5 different configurations for that function restricting and varying different parameters, and testing different interpretations of the simple problem statement (The mouse button should add a new ball). This was a time-consuming and ultimately fruitless process that was hindered by the fact that the autograder did not check these additional tests during the cooldown period. 

Could this functionality of the autograder be changed to allow for these additional tests to be performed during the cooldown period? I don&#39;t think students should be forced to deal with the tedium of waiting an hour (or more) between submissions to test one&#39;s interpretation of a problem, especially since instructors do not provide insight toward the intended interpretation. "	731

For the check-expects for the render-cat function (Part A of Q5), I understand that we need to test the bounds. So this would include right before, at, and after the bound for LEFT and RIGHT.

Additionally, I know that we need to test the middle of the screen when the cat is travelling across. In my check-expects, to test the middle, I had the below test but the autograder marked it incorrect. When looking at the solutions, it uses the constant MID to test the middle.

If I&#39;m not mistaken, wouldn&#39;t the logic be the same if I used an x of 20 or 40 as opposed to MID?

I know we use the template of the TypeData we have a template for; however, in some cases like for the KeyEvent function where we consume KeyEvent and a list for example the template seems to change.

I understand that the template in that case is from KeyEvent, but in the @template-origin tag do we also add, for example ListOfFlight, String, etc.

Likewise, some KeyEvent or MouseEvent templates have the typical predicate cond question but then have (... str), (... lof), etc as their answer. Is that because we use the main template for KeyEvent/MouseEvent and then operate on the other DataType?

2023-10-04T14:53:50Z	"Question about argument type in result type in signature I was working through the 2022w1-m1 question 4, and I was confused about why autograder said that Number is the argument type even though Natural is the result type in the signature:

(@htdf delivery-weight)
(@signature Number ListOfPackage -&gt; Natural)

At first, I thought that the signature was (@signature Natural ListOfPackage -&gt; Natural) volume would be a positive number or zero.

Why is Number used as an argument type?


EDIT: 
Here is what the question asks:

Design a function that produces the total weight of all the packages in the listthat both contain fragile items and have a volume less than given.  For example:

  (delivery-weight 40 (cons P1 (cons P3 (cons P2 (cons P4 empty)))))
should produce 300 since P4 is the only package in the list that containsfragile items and has a volume less than 40.  

  (delivery-weight 150 (cons P3 (cons P1 (cons P4 empty))))
should produce 500 since both P3 and P4 contain fragile items and have a volume less that 150; their combined weights is 300 &#43; 200.

Is it because Number is not the name of the data definition (unlike Foo), and because Number is a primitive type whereas Foo is not?
Adding on, is this also why there is no natural recursion from (bar-x f) to fn-for-foo in the fn-for-foo function definition?

I tried running (run-editor &#34;apple&#34;) in the terminal and Drracket gives me: editor-pre: expects an editor, given false
But I followed the template and am unsure why editor-pre expects an editor when it should be a String?

The error points to (editor-pre e) in my render function: 
(define (render e)  (overlay/align &#34;left&#34;                 &#34;middle&#34;                 (beside (text (editor-pre e) TEXT-SIZE TEXT-COLOR)                         (if (editor-cursor? e)                             (rectangle 1 20 &#34;solid&#34; &#34;red&#34;)                             (rectangle 1 20 &#34;outline&#34; &#34;white&#34;))                         (text (editor-post e) TEXT-SIZE TEXT-COLOR))                 MTS))

Some other things I&#39;m not sure about are my main function (what cursor? boolean would be) and if there&#39;s any other parameters to put into the run-editor function:

I uploaded a photo in this case to see the way in which it passes the yellow line.

Would I just force a line break in this case? How would I do this without breaking style rules? Are there any style rules regarding this?

(flight-ori F1) (flight-des F1)))                   (&lt; (/ (flight-loa F1) (flight-cap F1)) 0.8))) ;true(check-expect (low-load-international? F2)              (and (not (string=? (flight-ori F2) (flight-des F2)))                   (&lt; (/ (flight-loa F2) (flight-cap F2)) 0.8))) ;false(check-expect (low-load-international? F3)              (and (not (string=? (flight-ori F3) (flight-des F3)))                   (&lt; (/ (flight-loa F3) (flight-cap F3)) 0.8))) ;true

Instead of what the answer key had: 
(check-expect (unprofitable-flight?               (make-flight &#34;Canada&#34; &#34;Canada&#34; 100 81))              false)(check-expect (unprofitable-flight?               (make-flight &#34;United States&#34; &#34;United States&#34; 100 80))              false)(check-expect (unprofitable-flight?               (make-flight &#34;Austria&#34; &#34;Austria&#34; 100 79))              false)(check-expect (unprofitable-flight?               (make-flight &#34;Finland&#34; &#34;Mexico&#34; 200 162))              false)(check-expect (unprofitable-flight?               (make-flight &#34;Chile&#34; &#34;Argentina&#34; 100 79))              true)(check-expect (unprofitable-flight?               (make-flight &#34;Chad&#34; &#34;Australia&#34; 200 158))              true)

I know my check-expects are less readable, but they have less calculation error (since the two number parameters are divided by each other) and have the same outcome as the answer key. The operations I made also helped me a lot with forming the low-load-international? function). Are my check-expects acceptable for exams? Thank you! 

For context, here are the constants: 
(define F1 (make-flight &#34;Canada&#34; &#34;Denmark&#34; 90 70))(define F2 (make-flight &#34;Canada&#34; &#34;Canada&#34;  120 100))(define F3 (make-flight &#34;Brazil&#34; &#34;Canada&#34;  250 180))

(define (fn-for-movie m)
  (... (movie-title m)
       (movie-budget m)
       (movie-year-released m)))
to this?

(define (fn-for-movie m)
  (... (movie-title m)
       (movie-budget m)
       (movie-year--released m))) (added 1 more dash!)
or would it stay the same?

2. In the functions, is the template-origin supposed to be Movie or not? Reason I am asking is because I added new variables and also removed the variable used in the template of Movie. Like I added m1 and m2 and removed m.

3. In my function template, would it be:

(@template
 (define (newer m1 m2)
   (... (movie-title m)
        (movie-budget m)
        (movie-year-released m))))

2023-10-02T19:47:27Z	"2019 W2 M1 Problem 3 &amp; 5 Hi, I have a question about the order of the data type we put in the signature. From problem 3, it says we need to debug the signature because the order of Image and Number is switched. I think I can understand that because the check-expects have Image as first parameter and Number as second parameter.  This is the debugged version from solution:


(@htdf bigger?)                                          ;1. PREDICATE NAME NEEDS TO INCLUDE ?(@signature Image Number -&gt; Boolean)   ;2.SIGNATURE NUMBER IMAGE SWITCHED;; produce true if img perimeter is bigger than given value, false otherwise
(check-expect (bigger? (rectangle 10 5 &#34;solid&#34; &#34;blue&#34;) 20) true)(check-expect (bigger? (rectangle 10 5 &#34;solid&#34; &#34;blue&#34;) 40) false) (check-expect (bigger? (rectangle 5 8 &#34;solid&#34; &#34;blue&#34;) 40) false)

However, for problem 5, the question has (@signature  Balloon KeyEvent -&gt; Balloon), the question:

(@htdf handle-key)(@signature Balloon KeyEvent -&gt; Balloon);; on space flip rate from &#43; to - or vice versa; on p change color to purple
(check-expect (handle-key B0 &#34; &#34;) B0)(check-expect (handle-key B0 &#34;p&#34;) B0)(check-expect (handle-key B0 &#34;down&#34;) B0)(check-expect (handle-key B1 &#34; &#34;) (make-balloon MIN &#34;red&#34; 3))(check-expect (handle-key B2 &#34; &#34;) (make-balloon MAX &#34;green&#34; -2))(check-expect (handle-key B1 &#34;p&#34;) (make-balloon MIN &#34;purple&#34; -3))(check-expect (handle-key B2 &#34;up&#34;) B2)
;(define (handle-key b ke) b);  ; stub


so I assumed that we should write the template this way, I wrote it this way and my function also passed the check-expects:

(@template-origin Balloon KeyEvent)
(@template (define (handle-key b ke)             (cond [(false? b) (...)]                   [else (cond [(key=? ke &#34; &#34;) (...

This is the code from the mt1 p2 solution from 2023 summer. I am wondering why is it (@template-origin String). Doesn&#39;t @template-origin take in the first part of the Signature? I might be wrong on this point...

I understand that there are a number of cases where this is not necessary (most of the ones we have seen thus far), but there are cases where it would be helpful, such as problem bank Self-Ref P5 (with a function named &#34;largest&#34; which is meant to return the largest number in a list), in which there is the constraint that the numbers must be larger than zero. If we ensured that the rest of the list contains elements (isn&#39;t empty) before calling the function recursively (or if we checked that the consumed list isn&#39;t empty before calling a separate recursive function), the constraint would not be necessary. Is there a reason that this is not done in this solution, or is it just that we have not yet had any problems where such a solution is completely necessary?

Here is the function from the solution file of the mentioned problem bank question:

Question asks me to design ListOfImage and function to sum all of area on the ListOfImage

Weird thing in here is that on the data definition, they make example of circle, however, they did not specify how to compute area depending on circle, rectangle, triangle on the function.

Shouldn&#39;t we have if statement like if circle, (sqr (/ (image-width img) 2) * pi and (/ (sqr (image-width img)) 2) for triangle?

Why do they only use multiplying width and height even though the question does not specify that the image is only rectangle and square?"	578

2023-10-01T05:08:05Z	Is not having a black highlight a good indication of our program? I understand that whenever we run the code and something is highlighted in black, it means it has not been tested. Would this be a good indication of how thorough our check-expect tests are? Should we aim to essentially test everything and have nothing highlighted in black?	576

The question asks you to write a function that produces the number of flights in a list of flights whose origin is not equal to destination AND load/capacity ratio is less than 0.8

I&#39;ve chosen to solve this using a helper function helper function that takes (first lof) and the natural recursion (unprofitable-flights (rest lof)) as input and adds 1 to the natural recursion if the flight (first lof) satisfies the requirements of the problem statement:

In contrast, within lecture we were told that the last element of something like L1 would actually be &#34;Design&#34; NOT (cons &#34;Design&#34; empty). I was hoping to get clarification on if there was any specific difference between asking for an &#34;element&#34; from a list or the &#34;first/rest&#34; of the list. My confusion also stems from the edx module saying that calling on (first L1) would result in &#34;Program&#34;, which is specifically the first ELEMENT of the following list. Why is &#34;rest&#34; not producing &#34;Program&#34; and &#34;Design&#34; as the remaining elements as mentioned in lecture?

Through lectures and edX lessons, we are being taught to construct lists using 

(cons &#34;a&#34; (cons &#34;b&#34; (cons &#34;c&#34; empty)))
However, this method of appending lists together to an empty list seems counterintuitive. What stops us from constructing a list instead of appending?

Looking into this, I found the function list:

(list &#34;a&#34; &#34;b&#34; &#34;c&#34;)
which is fundamentally identical to the function above, but I find it much simpler to read and work with.

For handle-mouse,  the solution has a lot more check-expects than I did. I was wondering why we need so many check expects? Wouldn&#39;t these be enough:

(check-expect (handle-mouse 5 100 150 &#34;button-down&#34;) 100)
(check-expect (handle-mouse 50 10 15 &#34;button-up&#34;) 50)
(check-expect (handle-mouse 0 0 5 &#34;button-down&#34;) 0)
(check-expect (handle-mouse 0 9 6 &#34;button-up&#34;) 0)

Solution code:

;; Below is a world program in which a cat walks across the screen
;; from left to right. Pressing the space key resets the cat to the
;; left edge of the screen.
;;
;; Revise this program so that when the mouse is clicked in the window 
;; the cat moves to the mouse&#39;s current x position. You will need to
;; consult the DrRacket help desk to learn about the four arguments to
;; big-bang on-mouse handlers.

Hello, I have question regarding setting constants for problems. In the traffic light question from the problem bank, the solution shows the constants for the lights already being in place with overlay and above. However, when I did this question, I made constants just for each light&#39;s state (code above for how I did it), and the changing information is the light&#39;s state throughout the program. My question is during an exam setting would this be okay or do I really need to aim to make things more clear and simple like the solution, and I&#39;ll lose marks if I don&#39;t. "	460

2023-09-24T06:23:26Z	"Problem Bank Spinning Make-Box Starter I was checking my code with the solution and I noticed there was a difference between them. In the code, you are supposed to make a square that spins. I decided that whenever the angle a became greater than 360, I would use the remainder function. I did this in the tock function like so:


(define (tock ss)
  (if (&gt; (&#43; ROTATIONAL-SPEED (spinning-square-a ss)) 360)
      (make-spinning-square
       (&#43; (spinning-square-l ss) LENGTH-INCREASE)
       (remainder (&#43; (spinning-square-a ss) ROTATIONAL-SPEED) 360))
      
      (make-spinning-square
       (&#43; (spinning-square-l ss) LENGTH-INCREASE)
       (&#43; (spinning-square-a ss) ROTATIONAL-SPEED))))

However, the solution used the remainder function in the render function like so:

(define (render-box b)
  (place-image (rotate (remainder (box-a b) 360)
                       (square (box-s b) &#34;solid&#34; SQUARE-COLOR))
               CTR-X
               CTR-Y

For instance in lecture yesterday, we were told that if (&#43; (spider-y s) (spider-dy s)) &gt;= BOT, then the spider can bounce off the bottom of the screen.

(cond [(&gt;= (&#43; (spider-y s) (spider-dy s)) BOT)
       (make-spider BOT (- (spider-dy s)))]
      [(&lt;= (&#43; (spider-y s) (spider-dy s)) TOP)
       (make-spider TOP (- (spider-dy s)))]
      [else
       (make-spider (&#43; (spider-y s) (spider-dy s))
                    (spider-dy s))])

However, what if we interpreted this as (&#43; (spider-y s) (spider-dy s) &gt; BOT?

In the lecture video HtDW With Compound Data Part 3, the cow doesn&#39;t bounce off the screen until (&#43; (cow-x c) (cow-dx c)) &gt; WIDTH.

(cond [(&gt; (&#43; (cow-x c) (cow-dx c)) WIDTH) 
       (make-cow WIDTH (- (cow-dx c))]
...
      [else
       (make-cow (&#43; (cow-x c) (cow-dx c))
                  (cow-dx c))]

Likewise in the Cowabunga render-cow function, a helper function called choose-image was defined to choose the next image on the screen.

Couldn&#39;t we have interpreted the render-cow function as displaying the RCOW if dx = (&#43;) and LCOW if dx = (-)? Is there even a need for a helper function?"	436

2023-09-22T08:05:14Z	"Images as values of enum. impact on HtDD for HtDW Hi, I want to check that you can indeed use Images as your values in an enumeration?

If so, can you use the change in images as the data definition when creating a world, or should you instead have an enum of a string/something else that changes within what you see of the image, and then render from that?
for example: the program shows a circle, then a rectangle, then the circle, etc. Can your data definition be those images or should it be an enum of &#34;circle&#34; and &#34;square&#34;, and then you create the images to render within the render function?

If I recall correctly (this was either mentioned in a video or during a lecture), atomic data is used to represent information that loses its meaning when broken down. For example, if you broke down the string &#34;red&#34; into multiple characters &#34;r&#34; &#34;e&#34; and &#34;d&#34;, the meaning of the string (the colour red) is lost.

Suppose that you had a date of birth, such as &#34;2000/03/14&#34;. When the string is broken down into individual characters (in this case, digits) the meaning is lost because the individual digits do not provide any information when separated. However, if the date is broken down into the year, month and day (&#34;2000&#34;, &#34;03&#34; and &#34;14&#34;), the individual components still have a meaning.

The design recipies page does NOT use a final else when templating for itemization, however, the solution for HtDD NV5 includes a final ELSE in the cond, so I&#39;m not sure as which to follow.

I am guessing that both are valid, but I personally find using a final &#34;else&#34; is pretty ambiguous when compared with how rigid and explicit all the other programming we&#39;ve done has been.

Please advise. Which should I use? Does it matter? What is the explanation for this final else?"	341

My questions are two in there.

First, do we need to use (@template-origin) and (@template) for (@htdf)?

As far as I remember, in the edx video, we just skipped to type template for htdf because we have done in htdd.
Also, in the lecture this morning, I think prof does not use template for htdf as well.

Second, do we really need to use cond expression to get full mark?
The question only ask whether the BuildingStatus is &#34;old&#34; or not.

So, I just use

(define (demolish? bs)
  (string=? &#34;old&#34; bs))
Instead of such a long cond expression.

I get full mark for this in Autograder. But I am not sure the mark could go down after TAs have a look in the real situation.


Third, do we really, must follow the Design Recipe specifically for the template?

In the template, it says use  cond expression for enumeration. Therefore, our function body follow it.

if we have a better, simple solution like mine, can we just use template as

(define (demolish? bs)
  (string=? &#34;old&#34; bs) false)
Or we just need to specifically, must follow the Design Recipe&#39;s template?"	326

(define (fn-for-countdown c)
  (cond [(false? c) (...)]
        [(and (number? c) (&lt;= 1 c) (&lt;= c 10)) (... c)]
        [else (...)]))
In the video, after we looked at the Data Driven Template for numbers, he mentioned that because of c could be String, we should guard (and (&lt;= 1 c) (&lt;= c 10)) with (number? c).

After that, because we know that c is not Boolean and Number, we do not need to guard with (string=? c). Instead, Just put else.

My questions about this lecture are....

1. Then why do we use 

[(and (number? c) (&lt;= 1 c) (&lt;= c 10)) (... c)]
Instead of

[((number? c) (... c)]
Because there is only one case which c is number, so if c is number, it must be between 1 to 10.
Therefore, I think we do not need (&lt;= 1 c) (&lt;= c 10). They are redundant.

2. If the above question is not, which we need to include the range of c, does it mean that we assume input c can be any number? So, is this why we need to include the range of c?

If so, why don&#39;t we guard &#34;complete&#34;? it could be any string, not necessarily &#34;complete&#34;. Therefore

[else (...)]))
should be

[(and (string? c) (string=? &#34;complete&#34; c) (...)]))

2023-09-14T17:26:10Z	"Question Regarding Guards and Simplification of Guards in HtDD According to the video, if the subclass of our data definition is the last of its type, we can replace the cond question with the guard.

Example:

;; Data is one of:
;; - &#34;A&#34;
;; - Number, restricted to &gt; 0
;; - &#34;B&#34;

(define (fn-for-Data d)

	(cond [(and (string? d) (string=? d A) (...)]
	      [(number? d) (... d)]

When he talked about a function that takes an image and returns the area of the image, the signature should be Image -&gt; Natural instead of Image -&gt; Number

Please let me know if this question is in the wrong place. Now that Lab-01 is complete and graded, I assume we can discuss the solutions here. 

For my problem 5 solution, I used 

(string-ref ...)
to collect the first character of the STR constant, which returns a char. I then used

(char=? ... ...)
to determine whether the first characters were equal. To declare the letter &#34;h&#34;, rather than using the string &#34;h&#34; (which would not pass into char=? as it is a str not a char), I used the character notation #\h. This resulted in lost marks on my lab, which were not indicated by the autograder (understandable). 

I was wondering whether this solution also satisfies the problem statement, given that:
&#34;Write an expression that computes whether the first character in the value of STR is &#34;h&#34;. If you do not change the constant definition for STR in the starter file, the expected result is true.&#34;

What differences are there between the names of cities and the names of provinces, such that one is atomic non-distinct and another is atomic distinct?

Edit: Could it be based on the context of how it is designed?
While city name is atomic non-distinct when the data does not specify which city (eg. CityName is String), it becomes atomic distinct when it becomes part of the &#34;one-of&#34; (eg. City is one of: &#34;Vancouver&#34; &#34;Burnaby&#34; &#34;Richmond&#34;)."	282

2023-09-08T04:35:50Z	"DrRacket and the 80 or 102 character limit per line - Why? 

So I ran into this problem today when trying to hand in my assignment, which was a shock at first leading me to look around in DrRacket only to realize that this is very much intended (Section 6.4 line width) and what seems to be part of the design of the program, at least from what I could see. I relented and ended up spending some time to split a bunch of my comment lines until i could finally submit the file. However, even though the article had provided its own reasoning I failed to see the point of it. Yes, longer lines may be harder to display 
on some screens and will require the use of the scroll bar to read fully. But an arbitrary character limit does not seem very intuitive. The lecture starter in question was fairly simple and had short lines of code, but what happens when more complicated code that needs more space to be expressed? I do not think every single line of code can be easily split into multiple lines without either causing problems or at the very least look kind of messy.
Maybe there is some unspoken explanation relating to workplace habits or something like &#34;if it is too long and cannot be split easily your code is bad&#34; out there. But I could not really find any discussion about this character limit, only that it exists and there was a little blurb written about it."	155
2023-09-08T04:23:27Z	"Questions Regarding the Rocket Descent Practice Problem from HtDD (HtDD P3 - Rocket Descent)

1. Question Regarding the Data Definition

;; RocketDescent is one of
;; - Number (0, 100]
;; - &#34;complete&#34;
;; interp. The rocket&#39;s remaining descent. When descent is 0, RocketDescent is &#34;complete&#34;
I&#39;m quite confused as to how to define the range of values for the RocketDescent data type. The solution has defined the range of values to be Number (0, 100]. However, would we be penalized for specifying Number [0, 100] (i.e. including time = 0)?When the rocket lands, could I specify RocketDescent as being equal to &#34;complete&#34; rather than false?
2. Question regarding simplifying the code
Would we lose marks if we choose not to simplify our solution?

(define (RocketDescent r)
	(cond [(and (number? r) (&gt; r 0) (&lt;= r 100)) (... r)]          (Case 1)
				[else (...)]))
Since the subclass corresponding to the first cond statement is the last of its type, we could replace the cond question with the guard:

(define (RocketDescent r)
	(cond [(number? r) (... r)]          (Case 2)
				[else (...)]))
Would we lose marks for not simplifying our solution as per Case 2 above?

3. Check-expect statements of our function.

If the data RocketDescent takes on values of Number [0, 100], what sort of checks would we need in our function examples?
My guess is that we need to check both boundaries (0 and 100) and a mid-point (50). However, would we need to check a decimal value as well?


(check-expect (rocket-descent-to-msg 0) &#34;0 km&#34;)
(check-expect (rocket-descent-to-msg 100) &#34;100 km&#34;)
(check-expect (rocket-descent-to-msg 50) &#34;50 km&#34;)
(check-expect (rocket-descent-to-msg 40.5) &#34;40.5 km&#34;)  &lt;-- is this even needed?

I know that UBC has procedures to follow if one has a scheduling conflict between midterms for different classes. I am not sure about the scheduling conflicts between midterms and classes. 

I believe this might be of interest to students who take CPSC 110 and CPSC 121 Section 103. I can see on the course schedule that midterms are scheduled for the following timeslots:

MT1 - October 5 (Thursday) at 6 pmMT2 - November 16 (Thursday) at 6 pm
However, the CPSC 121 Section 103 is scheduled to start at 5 pm and end at 6:30 pm on Thursdays. There is an overlap of 30 minutes for when the MT1 &amp;2 are scheduled.

Given everything stated above, what will be the best course of action to mitigate the time overlaps between scheduled midterms and CPSC 121 class? Is there an individual in the CPSC department who will be able to advise on this one? 

This might be too early to bring up...

Thank you for your responses in advance!

Kind regards,

Can we please have a clarity on Autograder Cool Down Period please? 

Firstly, I already have checked on the syllabus about this issue but could not find details.

Secondly, I have checked the time at the very corner of the message when cool down period ends.

Thirdly, how often does it go to Cool Down Period. I only submitted once then it went to Cool Down. Is there any issue right now?

Piazza is a Q&A platform designed to get you great answers from classmates and instructors fast. We've put together this list of tips you might find handy as you get started:

 Ask questions!

The best way to get answers is to ask questions! Ask questions on Piazza rather than emailing your teaching staff so everyone can benefit from the response (and so you can get answers from classmates who are up as late as you are).

Edit questions and answers wiki-style.

Think of Piazza as a Q&A wiki for your class. Every question has just a single students' answer that students can edit collectively (and a single instructors’ answer for instructors).

 Add a followup to comment or ask further questions.

To comment on or ask further questions about a post, start a followup discussion. Mark it resolved when the issue has been addressed, and add any relevant information back into the Q&A above.

 Go anonymous.

Shy? No problem. You can always opt to post or edit anonymously.

 Tag your posts.

It's far more convenient to find all posts about your Homework 3 or Midterm 1 when the posts are tagged. Type a “#” before a key word to tag. Click a blue tag in a post or the question feed to filter for all posts that share that tag.

 Format code and equations.

Adding a code snippet? Click the pre or tt button in the question editor to add pre-formatted or inline teletype text. 
Mathematical equation? Click the Fx button to access the LaTeX editor to build a nicely formatted equation.

 View and download class details and resources. 

Click the Course Page button in your top bar to access the class syllabus, staff contact information, office hours details, and course resources—all in one place!


Contact the Piazza Team anytime with questions or comments at team@piazza.com. We love feedback!"	1
